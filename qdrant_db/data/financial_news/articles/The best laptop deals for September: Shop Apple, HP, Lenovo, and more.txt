A new laptop is almost certainly a splurge, but keeping your eyes peeled for deals can make it much easier to take the leap on an upgrade. The good news is that you've got options at a variety of price points via Best Buy, Amazon, and beyond, whether you're looking for an everyday workhorse, a cheap Chromebook for homework, a 2-in-1 Windows PC for drawing, or a powerful premium gaming laptop.

Read on for our running list of the best laptop deals as of Sept. 21. (And if you don't see any models that check all the boxes on your spec wish list, come back soon: We add new picks every other week.)

Note: Retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart occasionally list incorrect MSRPs for laptops, making deals appear better or worse than they really are. If an MSRP you see below differs from the one shown on the laptop's product page, it's because we cross-checked it with the machine's manufacturer and corrected it.

Why we like it

This entry-level Dell laptop features a 12th-generation (2022) Intel Core i3 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage, and a 15.6-inch non-touch display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It's nothing spectacular and a little outdated, but this is a spec sheet we rarely see at this price point. (Hell, even some nicer laptops don't have 120Hz refresh rates — M3 Apple MacBook Air included!)

It's marked down to $269.99 on Dell's website, which is 29% off and the lowest price we've ever seen it hit. (The 256GB model dipped to that same price two weeks ago; it's now $10 more expensive.)

Why we like it

This 14-incher is a mostly baseline Chromebook Plus with an Intel Core i3-N305 from early 2023, 8GB of memory, 128GB of eMMC storage, a 1080p IPS display, and a 1080p webcam. But premium details like a backlit keyboard and a cover made of metal, not plastic, give it a leg up over other models in the series.

A $549.99 value, you can grab it on sale for just $379.99 during a Weekend Flash Sale on Lenovo's website — just be sure to enter the promo code LENOVOFLASHWKD at checkout. (You'll see it listed for $399.99 on its product page; that extra $20 will come off once it's added to your cart.)

Read Mashable's full review of the HP OmniBook X 14.

This Mashable Choice Award-winning Copilot+ PC is one of the best Windows laptops we've tested all year — it's "a serious MacBook competitor" that's faster and longer-lasting than Apple's 15-inch M3 Air, said Mashable Tech Editor Kim Gedeon.

The Meteor Silver model with Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite CPU, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage has fallen to a new record-low of $899.99 on HP's website (normally $1,149.99) as part of its Fall Savings Event. That works out to a 21% savings.

Read Mashable's full review of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Air.

Apple's latest MacBook Air takes the excellent design of its predecessor and upgrades it with a faster processor, support for WiFi 6E, and the ability to drive two external displays with its lid closed. It's our current favorite MacBook for most people and another Mashable Choice Award winner.

The base configuration of the 15-inch model (which has two more speakers than the 13-inch version) normally retails for $1,299, but you can order it from Amazon for $1,099. That's 15% off, and $50 away from its all-time low price from Amazon Prime Day 2024.
