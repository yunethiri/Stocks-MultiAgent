As Huawei tries to upstage Apple 's new iPhone with the launch of its own 'trifold phone' on Tuesday, its chip capabilities remain a weakness, despite recent breakthroughs, according to one analyst.

Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Tuesday, Martin Yang, senior analyst of emerging technologies at Oppenheimer & Co., said Huawei's chip remains two or three years behind the cutting edge.

The gap on technology for their systems-on-chip, or SoCs, that merge central processing with cellular connectivity, is "widening because [Huawei] still doesn't have access to any below 7 nanometer processes," said Yang. In chip manufacturing, a nanometer denotes the size of transistors on a processor.

The smaller the size of a transistor, the more can be fit on a chip, increasing its level of advancement.

Huawei had made a smashing breakthrough last year when it released its Mate 60 smartphone, which included an advanced 7-nanometer chip originating from China.

The speed in which Chinese firms were able to reach this benchmark surpassed what many analysts thought possible under U.S. trade restrictions that limited China's access to advanced semiconductor tech.

On the back of this success, Huawei has been able to take back market share from Apple in China, the largest smartphone market in the world.

However, unlike with the Mate 50, Huawei has not announced a big chip breakthrough for its latest phone launch.
