content: Apple (AAPL) is gearing up for its highly anticipated product launch event on Monday, September 9th. To provide insights into what consumers can expect, CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco joins Asking for a Trend to discuss.

Eadicicco notes that investors are primarily focused on the likely iPhone 16 product line-up, which is expected to be the "star of the show." However, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple is also set to unveil three new Apple Watch models and updated AirPods.

"I think the big question on everybody's mind is gonna be how does Apple Intelligence play into all of this," Eadicicco states. She points out that some anticipated features include AI-powered text rewriting and email summarization, as well as an enhanced version of Siri tailored to individual users.

Regarding Apple's AI integration, Eadicicco told Yahoo Finance, "I think Apple's approach, based on what we've seen, is more contextual, it's more about kind of connecting the dots between the different apps on your phone and kind of using Siri as a way to do that." However, she cautions that these new AI features may not necessarily drive a widespread upgrade cycle among consumers.
