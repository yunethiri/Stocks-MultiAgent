Business leaders have attempted to establish a positive rapport with Trump since his election win in November.

Bank of America <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BAC.N" target="_blank">(BAC.N)</a>, the second-largest U.S. lender, also plans to contribute to Trump's inaugural committee but has yet to decide on the amount.
Trump will take office in January. He said in October when he was running for the White House that he received a call from Cook over concerns about the financial penalties that have been imposed by the European Union on the iPhone maker.
European regulators have launched a series of investigations into Big Tech firms in recent years, with the aim of curbing their power and ensuring a level playing field for smaller rivals. A U.S. Justice Department case accuses the iPhone maker of unlawfully dominating the smartphone market.
Trump's team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Trump-Cook meeting was reported earlier by the New York Times.
