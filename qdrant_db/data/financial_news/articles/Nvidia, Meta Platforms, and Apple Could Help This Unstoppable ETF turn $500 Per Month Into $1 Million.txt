content: The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is still in its infancy, but investors already witnessed its incredible potential to create value. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) market capitalization has grown from $360 billion to $3.3 trillion, almost entirely because of soaring sales of its AI data center chips.

But the industry is evolving fast, so picking the long-term winners and losers won't be easy. That's why buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds several different AI stocks could be the best strategy for investors. It can offer exposure to the value created by AI in a diversified manner, which can insulate investors from severe losses if some companies fail.

The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) holds practically every top AI stock (including Nvidia), so here's why it might be one of the best choices for investors of all experience levels.

Several popular AI stocks packaged into one ETF

The iShares exchange-traded fund (ETF) has a relatively broad portfolio featuring 276 stocks. That's because it isn't specifically an AI fund -- its objective is to invest across the technology sector overall, in addition to the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. It just so happens that many of the largest companies in those market segments are laser focused on developing AI.

Despite holding hundreds of stocks, the iShares ETF is very concentrated. Its top three positions alone account for 25.3% of the value of its entire portfolio:

Stock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 8.73% 2. Nvidia 8.33% 3. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) 8.24%

Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 16, 2024, and are subject to change.

Meta, Nvidia, and Apple could be three of the most important names in AI over the long term. Meta created the world's most popular open-source large language model (LLM), called Llama, which has been downloaded more than 600 million times. The company is using it to create AI features for Facebook and Instagram, but Llama also provides businesses and developers with a cost effective way to create AI software.

Meta plans to launch Llama 4 next year, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg says could be the most advanced LLM in the entire AI industry. That would be an incredible accomplishment since many other companies (like OpenAI) had a head start of several years.

Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center are the most advanced in the industry for developing AI. The company just started shipping its new Blackwell chips, which offer a significant performance boost compared to its flagship H100, and sales are expected to ramp up extremely fast. That's why I think Nvidia could be one of the best performing stocks in the tech sector next year.
