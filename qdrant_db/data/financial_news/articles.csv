Bezos Expeditions, the Amazon (AMZN) founder’s private investment vehicle, was part of a $693 million funding round for Tenstorrent, the company announced Monday. He joined LG Electronics and Fidelity in the round led by South Korean firms Samsung Securities and AFW Partners.

“We are excited by the breadth of investors that believe in our vision,” Keith Witek, the chief operating officer of Tenstorrent, in a statement. “If you look at this group, you see a balance of financial investors and strategic investors, as well as some notable individuals that have conviction in our plans for AI.”

Tenstorrent said it will use the money to “build out open-source AI software stacks, hire developers, expand its global development and design centers, and build systems and clouds for AI developers.”

The company has strived to provide more accessible and affordable solutions for companies looking to develop their AI capabilities, putting itself in direct competition with fellow Santa Clara, California-based firm Nvidia. So far, it has signed about $150 million in contracts, Tenstorrent said.

Currently the second-most valuable company in the world behind Apple (AAPL), Nvidia is a Wall Street powerhouse and a behemoth in the AI chip space. Last month, it reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, with 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — coming from only three unnamed customers. Those sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to filing.

Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet, Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom.

But smaller companies are struggling to build up their AI capabilities as Big Tech firms corner the market — and power-hungry AI chips remain prohibitively expensive.

That’s where Tenstorrent is hoping to come in. Founder and CEO Jim Keller told Bloomberg that Tenstorrent uses open-source and commonplace technology to provide engineering solutions that put AI in reach for more firms, and skips costly and complex parts, including like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used by Nvidia.

“You can’t beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,” Keller said. “But they’ll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.”

Open-source technology has become increasingly popular amid the AI boom, given its cost effectiveness. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company’s first open-source, multimodal large language model, Llama 3.2, will be the way forward.

“It’s sort of like the Linux of AI, and we’re seeing closed-source labs react by trying to slash their prices to compete with Llama,” he said at Meta’s annual Connect conference in September.

Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI also made its chatbot, Grok-1, an open-source model.

With strong earnings expected from a widespread array of companies in 2025 and US economic growth anticipated to remain resilient, the fundamental story for further market increases remains intact for 2025. But strategists have warned about a more volatile year for stocks as uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate cuts and a new Donald Trump administration loom ahead.

""Bull markets can, will and should slow their pace from time-to-time, a period of digestion that in turn only accentuates the health of the underlying secular bull,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote in his 2025 outlook. ""So we believe 2025 will likely [be] defined by a more normalized return environment with more balanced performance across sectors, sizes, and styles.""

Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. Given his 6,100 call for the end of 2024, Belski's forecast returns in 2025 at 9.8%, right in line with the index's average historical gain.

The median year-end target for the S&P 500 among strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance sits at 6,600. This would represent about a 12% increase from the index's current level. The targets reach as high as Oppenheimer's 7,100 and as low as Sitfel's ""mid 5000s"" projection — the lone call among 17 strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance for the benchmark index to fall in the coming year.

Less 'magnificent' performance

In one sign of equities' resiliency, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks' massive outperformance continuing in 2025.

Through three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024 compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data.

But that margin is projected to fall to just 8 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018.

""The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns,"" Kostin wrote. ""Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493.""'",en,neutral,0.9966094493865967

Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. While that is $25 billion less than the previous three years' average, based on Vanda Research's data, it's still within the post-COVID-19 range — indicating a healthy appetite for the average investor to be engaged with markets.

The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows.

Nvidia has pulled in $29.8 billion in retail net inflows this year, per Vanda Research's findings, up from $11.4 billion last year. Tesla's retail inflows dropped to $14.7 billion from $48 billion in 2023.

Tesla still edged out Nvidia as the top holding in retail investor portfolios, however — representing a 10.58% average portfolio weighting compared to 10.33% for Nvidia.

The other four top tickers were more index-based trades levered to popular themes such as AI: Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (SOXL), Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).

""2024 was an eventful year for markets,"" Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini said. ""For the average retail investor, it was another great year of portfolio performance. Loyalty to tech names paid off.""

Retail investors' portfolios beat S&P, Nasdaq

Indeed that tech loyalty did pay off.

Vanda Research estimates that the average retail portfolio is up 40.74% this year, the second-highest performance since 2014. Only 2023's 41.94% performance was better over this 10-year time span.

On a flow-adjusted basis, Vanda Research noted that this would mark the second time retail investors have beaten the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in back-to-back calendar years and the first time since 2014 that the non-institutional crowd beat the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-apple-stock-2025-141300829.html,finance.yahoo.com,Where Will Apple Stock Be in 2025?,,2024-12-31T14:13:00.000Z,"Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have delivered returns of 33% in 2024 as of this Dec. 30. They have gained momentum since the company released results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended Sept. 28) on Oct. 31.

Many investors have turned bullish about Apple's prospects after seeing those results, which revealed upticks in sales of iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks. Additionally, the company's services business achieved double-digit percentage year-over-year growth during the quarter.

But what are the prospects for Apple's major product lines for 2025? Can this technology giant sustain its recent rally and head higher next year?

Artificial intelligence could give Apple's sales a nice boost in 2025

Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year in its fiscal Q4 to $94.9 billion. Adjusted earnings increased 12% to $1.64 per share after excluding the one-time impact of the State Aid decision by the European General Court. Including the impact of that decision, Apple's diluted earnings came in at $0.97 per share, down from $1.46 per share in the same quarter last year.

For the fiscal year, revenue rose 2% to $391 billion, but adjusted earnings, shrunk to $6.08 per share from $6.13 per share in fiscal 2023 (including the impact of the European General Court decision). This shows how Apple's growth accelerated toward the end of the fiscal year, which was attributable to the stronger sales of iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads.

These sales will likely further benefit from the growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in 2025. The company started rolling out its Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features across these products in 2024, and more features will be made available in 2025. It is expected that the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence will eventually drive a jump in sales of iPhones.

For instance, IDC is expecting shipments of iOS-based iPhones to increase by 3.1% in 2025, while Android device shipments are only forecast to grow by 1.7%.

Favorable scenarios can be expected for MacBooks and iPads as well. That's because sales of these devices are set to get a boost thanks to AI in 2025. Gartner is forecasting a 165% increase in shipments of AI PCs in 2025 to 114 million units. Given that Apple is the fourth-largest PC OEM (original equipment manufacturer), it is well-placed to benefit from the secular growth of the AI-enabled PC market.

Meanwhile, the tablet market has also gained impressive momentum, with shipments increasing 20% year over year in the third quarter of calendar 2024 (per IDC). Apple is the top player in tablets, with an almost 32% market share. All this puts Apple in a nice position to capitalize on what Gartner forecasts will be a 9.5% jump in device spending next year, driven by customers looking to gain access to AI features.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., has cashed in on the stock’s recent record highs by selling about $23 million worth last week, according to security filings.

Zuckerberg sold 35,921 shares for $21.7 million, according to one filing, and 2,311 shares for $1.4 million, according to a separate one.

Most Read from MarketWatch

The sales were in accordance with a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by Zuckerberg on Aug. 9, according to a form filed for the company’s third quarter. That plan allowed the executive to sell as many as 518,000 Class A Meta shares and 1.7 million Class B shares held by entities created to hold his shareholdings.

At the time, the plan was worth $1.3 billion.

Meta’s stock META has gained 67% this year to propel it to a market capitalization of $1.5 trillion, re- joining megacaps Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN in the trillion-dollar-market-cap club. The stock closed at a record high of $632.68 on Dec. 11.

Rule 10b5-1 plans are set up to automatically execute transactions when certain preset conditions — such as price, volume and timing — are met. They are used by company insiders to enable them to cash out their stock without appearing to benefit from nonpublic information they are privy to as part of their role.

Zuckerberg already sold $153 million of stock in early December. In all, he has sold a record of more than $2 billion of Meta’s stock this year, according to an analysis conducted by Fortune magazine.

Meta’s stock started the year with a big surprise for investors in the form of its first-ever dividend, which was unveiled with fourth-quarter earnings in February.

In 2023, Zuckerberg sold about $400 million worth of stock, breaking a two-year period in which the stock fell sharply as the company attempted a pivot toward the metaverse, an immersive virtual world accessed using virtual reality devices that never fully materialized.

The company spent much of 2023 cleaning house before refocusing on tech infrastructure to support artificial intelligence capabilities for users and businesses in 2024. In its most recent earnings report for the third quarter, the company said it expected $38 billion to $40 billion in capital spending this year.

Key Takeaways

Apple shares moved lower Monday morning, tracking a broader decline for U.S. stocks, but the company remains in striking distance of becoming the first ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.

A bearish evening star pattern has formed over the past three trading sessions, indicating a potential reversal in the stock.

Investors should watch key support levels on Apple's chart around $237 and $218, while also monitoring a chart-based bullish price target near $278.







Apple (AAPL) shares moved lower Monday morning, tracking a broader decline for U.S. stocks, but the company remains in striking distance of becoming the first ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.

Last Thursday, the company set a fresh record high just above $260 after Wedbush analysts led by Apple bull Dan Ives said that artificial intelligence (AI) demand sets the tech giant up for a “golden era of growth” in 2025. This week, investors will be watching if Apple shares can hit $264.62, the price need to reach a $4 trillion market cap.

The company first unveiled its AI-software marketed as Apple Intelligence back in June, but the rollout has been slow, with investors watching if a major upgrade cycle to access the features drives 2025 sales.

Apple shares were down 1.2% at $252.50 in midday trading Monday. Since the start of the year, Apple shares have gained around 31%, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s 24% increase over the same period.

Below, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify several important price levels that investors may be watching.

Evening Star Pattern Emerges

Apple shares have trended higher since breaking out above a broad ascending triangle formation earlier this month. However, a bearish evening star pattern has formed on the iPhone maker’s chart over the past three trading sessions, indicating a potential reversal.

Moreover, as the stock climbed to a record high last week, the relative strength index (RSI) made a comparatively shallower high to create a bearish divergence, a technical signal pointing to weakening price momentum.

It’s also worth noting volume spikes in the stock on June 21, Sept. 20, and Dec. 20, with these dates coinciding with triple witching days, suggesting portfolio rebalancing by larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds.

Let’s identify key support levels to watch if the stock undergoes a reversal, but also forecast a bullish price target to monitor if the shares continue their longer-term uptrend.

Key Support Levels to Watch

The first level to eye sits around $237. This location on the chart could attract buying interest near the 50-day moving average and the ascending triangle’s top trendline, an area that may flip from prior resistance into future support.

(AAPL): ‘It Was The Dumb Money That Was Getting Out, Because Warren Buffett Or One Of His Assistants Made Us Nervous’",,2024-12-30T05:31:36.000Z,"We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about.

As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned.

However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence.

Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement.

Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that ""rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing"" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. ""How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?"" wondered Cramer. ""It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added.

Its 500 large-cap and megacap components come from every sector of the economy, and reflect investing categories from value to growth. As those companies account for about 80% of the value of the U.S. stock market, the S&P 500 makes a fairly good proxy for it.

However, each company's weight in the index is proportional to its market cap, and some companies have in recent years grown so big that now, just a few have a disproportionate amount of influence over it. Today, more than one-third of the S&P 500's value comes from just eight companies.

The ""Fateful Eight""

If you follow the market, it should be no surprise that the broader market has become concentrated. High-flying tech and artificial intelligence stocks surged in price, with their gains offsetting hundreds of underperformers in the S&P 500 and carrying the index to a roughly 26% broader gain in 2024 (as of Dec. 27). Over the last two years, the S&P 500 is up by more than 55%. Here are the eight stocks that now make up roughly 34.4% of the market and their weights in the S&P 500:

1. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 7.66%

2. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 6.71%

3. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT): 6.37%

4. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 4.16%

5. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): 2.57%

6. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 2.48%

7. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG): 2.24%

8. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): 2.24%

The first seven names have become known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" due to their massive market shares in their industries, their fortress balance sheets, and their incredible technological innovations. However, after Broadcom's market cap recently surged past the $1 trillion mark, a group of Wall Street pundits added it to the pack, dubbing the expanded group the ""Fateful Eight."" Their performances this year have (with one exception) been extraordinary.

Every stock in the Fateful Eight except Microsoft outperformed the S&P 500 in 2024. In fact, all of those other seven have at least doubled the gains of the broader market. However, consider that 168 stocks in the S&P 500 are down for the year, while more than 70% of the names in the index have underperformed it.

Does this make the broader market risky?

Some might wonder if investing in the broader market is safe considering that such a large proportion of its gains have come from such a narrow group of companies. Many of the Fateful Eight trade at nosebleed valuations, making them more vulnerable to pullbacks if they deliver weak earnings or miss their guidance, or if inflation reignites. After all, Treasury yields have marched higher, and many investors pared back their expectations for interest rate cuts in 2025.

Particularly for cyclical companies, it can be a pretty good indicator of what's to come. I'm seeing a situation that looks extremely promising for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) as its setup is similar to the scenario it saw in 2020.

The last time Taiwan Semi had a setup similar to its current one, the stock doubled in the year that followed. So could it repeat that performance in 2025?

A revenue tailwind is emerging

Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest third-party chip manufacturer. It contracts out its chipmaking capacities to clients like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), meaning a significant chunk of the world's most powerful devices contain chips originating from TSMC's foundries.

Taiwan Semi also has the ability to produce chips using the most advanced process currently available -- the 3nm process node. Node sizes used to refer to the smallest distance in nanometers between specific features on a chip; while they don't anymore, each successive reduction in node size represents a meaningful improvement in the density and processing power of the chips it produces.

The 3nm node packs a lot of processing power, but Taiwan Semi is already working on a 2nm process, and expects to start using it to make chips for its clients in late 2025. All of this is reminiscent of how the company looked as it entered 2020.

Back then, Taiwan Semiconductor was just launching its 5nm chips, which were an improvement from its previous best 7nm chips. Additionally, a huge wave of chip demand was about to hit TSMC (although it didn't know it) when COVID-19 shut down the world, driving many people to upgrade their computers and other digital devices so that they could more effectively work, and learn remotely, and make use of video chat services to stay in touch with those outside their home.

As we enter 2025, there is massive demand for AI chips, and TSMC will roll out 2nm chips later this year. Back in Q3 2023, management forecast that sales of AI chips would grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the following five years, and predicted that at the end of that period, they would account for a percentage of its revenue in the low teens.

However, that growth has so far been even faster than management expected. AI revenue is projected to triple in 2024, and make up a mid-teens percentage of revenue. Management indicated there were no signs of that growth slowing down heading into 2025, so the types of secular trends that prevailed in 2020 should also be apparent in 2025.",en,neutral,0.9853159785270691

The company does not disclose which investment manager makes each individual trade, but Buffett is almost certainly in charge of large positions like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Despite once calling Apple the ""best business"" in the world, Buffett sold 100 million shares in the third quarter, cutting Berkshire's stake by 25%. And while Apple still ranked as the company's largest holding as of Sept. 30, Buffett has now sold more than 615 million shares in the last four quarters.

Meanwhile, Berkshire started a very small position in Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) in the third quarter. That stock is up 3,100% since its initial public offering (IPO) in July 2004, but it has struggled more recently. Shares have fallen 21% in the last three years, despite the S&P 500 advancing 28% during that period.

Here's what investors should know about Apple and Domino's.

Apple: The stock Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold in the third quarter

Apple has built brand authority and pricing power through engineering expertise. Its lineup of consumer electronics products is built on proprietary software that creates a seamless user experience across devices, and consumers are willing to pay for that. The average iPhone price was 3 times higher than the average Samsung smartphone price during the third quarter.

Apple has a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position (as measured by sales) in smartphones. However, the company in recent years has expanded its focus beyond hardware. Adjacent services like App Store downloads, iCloud storage, and Apple Pay let the company more efficiently monetize its installed base that exceeds 2.2 billion active devices.

Apple reported modest financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in September 2024. Revenue increased 6% on double-digit sales growth in the services segment, and mid-single-digit sales growth in the Mac, iPad, and iPhone segments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings increased 12% to $1.64 per diluted share.

Apple is a solid business, but not even the best business is worth buying at any price. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has risen from 26 in April to 42 in December without a meaningful catalyst. Sure, it recently launched Apple intelligence, a suite of artificial intelligence capabilities for newer iPhones and MacBooks. But that has yet to trigger the upgrade cycle predicted by so many analysts.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-stock-trade-is-starting-to-shift-beyond-the-magnificent-7-151133023.html,finance.yahoo.com,The AI stock trade is starting to shift beyond the 'Magnificent 7',,2024-12-27T15:11:33.000Z,"Investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence has once again driven the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks to another banner year, with Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) stocks all recently hitting record highs, while Nvidia (NVDA) shares boast a more than 175% gain this year.

Next year, investors expect the hype to spread even further into areas like utilities and software stocks, which will continue to benefit from Big Tech's large AI bet. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin projects the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025 and that the rest of the market's gains will come closer to those of large-cap tech stocks.

""It's less about valuation but more about earnings growth that will dictate those returns,"" Kostin said during a Goldman Sachs 2025 media roundtable with reporters. ""The narrowing of the differential between the growth rates is likely to lead to a narrowing of [difference in] the performance.""

The rapid earnings growth seen in large caps over the past 18 months is expected to slow, while earnings are expected to pick up for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, issued a 6,666 year-end target for the S&P 500 in 2025 that includes a call for a broadening of earnings driven in part by AI.

""AI is definitely playing a role in 2025 earnings,"" Subramanian told Yahoo Finance. ""And in fact, one of the reasons that we're bullish on the broadening out of earnings is the idea that instead of everybody spending on tech capex, tech capex is actually picking up, and tech companies are sort of spending on a broader array of industries.""

To Subramanian's point, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta alone are expected to have increased capital expenditures by 42% in 2024 and another 17% in 2025, pushing their total spend next year to $244 billion. Not all of this spending is on AI chips. Tech companies are also ramping up spending to pay for the power required to run AI data centers.

During a 2025 outlook roundtable with reporters, BlackRock's Investment Institute pointed out that the power required to operate one data center is about equal to the average amount of power used in a day by all of New York City. This has strategists, including BofA's Subramanian, bullish on the companies exposed to that part of the technology buildout, including the Utilities sector (XLU), which is already up more than 20% in 2024, partially driven by AI optimism.

The big victory came in August when the Justice Department convinced a federal district court judge that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) had abused its search engine dominance and violated antitrust law.

""Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,"" the judge wrote in his ruling.

It was the government’s most resounding antitrust victory against any major company since prosecutors went after AT&T in the 1980s and Microsoft in the 1990s.

Prosecutors then asked the same judge to force Google's parent Alphabet to sell off parts of its empire, a dramatic request that will play out in a separate phase of the trial in 2025. The end result could be the dismantling of a glittering Silicon Valley empire amassed over two decades.

What transpired in 2024 could have future implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims.

For now, Wall Street doesn't appear rattled. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks of the world's largest technology companies helped push the market higher in 2024, thanks partly to advancements around artificial intelligence.

They include Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Alphabet. Alphabet, in fact, hit an all-time record high this month.

• USD (GOOG) View Quote Details

Some legal experts argue that the government's antitrust gains in 2024 are still too premature to seriously rattle the gigantic tech companies.

""The Biden administration has moved antitrust down the field in some ways,"" said University of Tennessee law professor Maurice Stucke. ""But are we in the end zone? No.""

The cases that allege companies acted illegally to maintain a monopoly take years to work through the justice system. The more present dangers for tech giants, Stucke said, are the chances that the government will try to block newly proposed mergers or that their businesses could be eclipsed by AI startups.

""That sends them greater chills than any regulator,"" Stucke said. ""They don't want to be the next Intel.""

Amy Bos, director of state and federal affairs for technology sector advocate NetChoice (which also represents Yahoo Finance), agreed that the government's merger challenges pose the most looming threats.

""It shows in the boardrooms,"" she said. ""I think there's increased hesitation by companies whether to merge, whether to grow their business, because they may come under increased scrutiny.""

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025.

• USD (AAPL) View Quote Details

“We believe Apple is heading into a multi-year AI driven iPhone upgrade cycle that is still being underestimated by the Street,” wrote Ives, continuing, “Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will Apple's AI strategy but the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.”

Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday — a record intraday high — before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap.

Apple is closing 2024 on a winning streak after a tough start to the year. It faced struggling iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and clashes with antitrust regulators at home and abroad. Early data from the initial rollout of Apple’s iPhone 16 lineup didn’t do much to bolster Wall Street’s confidence, with investment firm Jefferies (JEF) issuing a rare downgrade on the stock.

Other analysts, Ives included, stayed bullish on the stock as more positive iPhone shipment data engendered confidence in Apple’s artificial intelligence strategy for its consumer devices. Apple’s fourth quarter earnings report in early November showed the tech giant beating expectations on iPhone sales, despite missing estimates overall.

Shares began to climb in early November to new highs as Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro lineup and, in mid December, added ChatGPT and other Apple Intelligence AI features for the iPhone, iPad and macOS. Apple has outperformed several of its so-called Magnificent Seven peers over the past month. While Apple shares have gained more than 11% during that time frame, Meta (META) rose 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT) climbed 4.4%, Nvidia (NVDA) popped 1%.

Still, macroeconomic uncertainty could create headwinds for Apple. Trump’s tariffs on China could impact prices for Apple products assembled in the country, with the worst case scenario adding $256 of cost per iPhone. The US Federal Reserve’s projection that it would lower interest rates less than expected in 2025 also caused fears of persistent higher rates and sticky inflation, dampening consumer confidence heading into the new year.",en,neutral,0.9786989688873291

Tesla's (TSLA) shares were the S&P 500's top gainers Tuesday as the Magnificent Seven big tech stocks rose on Christmas Eve.

Shares of the EV maker finished the day up more than 7%, making them the best performer sin the benchmark index—ahead of Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which rose about 6%.

Other ""Mag 7"" stocks also rose today, a holiday-shortened session that came ahead of a day off tomorrow and kicked off the Santa Claus Rally period. The major indexes all rose today, led by the Nasdaq Composite.

Amazon.com (AMZN) added 1.8%, the largest gain of the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Meta Platforms (META) added 1.3%. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) were also in the green.

All of the S&P 500's 11 sectors were in the green today.

Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave.

That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some.

And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead.

“Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.”

But the competition isn’t sitting idly by.

Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors.

And Wall Street is getting on board.

• USD (NVDA) View Quote Details

Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone.

Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible.

The dominator

Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips.

Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business.

Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence rollout could drive demand for the iPhone 16 this holiday season — and send the tech giant’s market value to a new record high.



Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a recent note that the Cupertino, California-based company “is set to have a strong holiday season ahead as iPhone 16 upgrades across its installed base are trending well into Christmas.”

In particular, Apple stands to sell upwards of 240 million iPhones in the 2025 fiscal year, fueled by AI-driven upgrades. The researchers said this could be “the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple’s history.”

Shares of Apple closed at $254.49 each Friday, up nearly 2%. So far this year, the company’s stock has surged 37%, lifting its market capitalization to $3.85 trillion. That makes it the most valuable company in the world, followed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Wedbush maintained its $300 price target, and said Apple is on track to become the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025.

Although iPhone sales jumped 6% year-over-year in the September quarter to $46.22 billion, the company’s annual revenue grew just 1% in the 2024 fiscal year.

While the company has been banking on its new AI features, known as Apple Intelligence, to supercharge sales, some analysts have warned that more substantial innovations will be needed to drive interest.

Wedbush said the “naysayers” are overlooking key opportunities within the company. With 2 billion iOS devices currently in use worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones, Wedbush believes that there are approximately 300 million iPhones that haven’t been upgraded within the past four years.

That, combined with a strong services business and the massive potential for Apple users to tap into AI through their iOS devices, could give Apple the boost it’s been gearing up for, the analysts said.

“We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launching pad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” they wrote.

However, had you invested $1,000 in shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) at the very same time, it would now be worth a whopping $42.5 million.

It was 1965 when Warren Buffett became the CEO of Berkshire. Now, he oversees a $291 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, in addition to several private wholly owned businesses. Berkshire is also sitting on $325 billion in cash, which Buffett and his team can put to work when they spot new opportunities.

Given Berkshire's incredible performance relative to the S&P 500, it's no surprise that Wall Street watches Buffett's every move. According to the conglomerate's 13-F filings, he is on a major selling spree in 2024.

However, Berkshire's financials for the third quarter revealed something even more surprising. For the first time in six years, Buffett didn't buy his favorite stock. Here's why that should be setting off alarm bells on Wall Street.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

Buffett slashed Berkshire's largest position this year

Berkshire spent around $38 billion buying shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) between 2016 and 2023, which is the most money it has ever invested in a single company. That position was worth over $170 billion at the start of 2024, so Berkshire was sitting on a very nice gain.

Apple accounted for half of the value of Berkshire's entire portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities at that point. The conglomerate did sell small quantities of Apple stock over the years to cash in some of its gains, but it significantly ramped up the selling in 2024.

Berkshire offloaded 13% of its Apple position in the first quarter, which Buffett said was for tax reasons. But the conglomerate then sold 49% of its remaining Apple shares in the second quarter, followed by 25% of what was left in Q3. No real reasons were provided.

Apple remains Berkshire's largest position with a 25.7% weighting in its portfolio, so Buffett probably hasn't adopted a highly negative view on the company. Besides, it wasn't the only stock Berkshire trimmed this year.

In 2024 so far, Berkshire reduced its stake in Chevron, T-Mobile, Capital One Financial, and Bank of America. It also sold its entire positions in Paramount Global, HP, Floor & Decor Holdings, and artificial intelligence company Snowflake.

As I mentioned earlier, Berkshire is now sitting on $325 billion in cash. It's the biggest pile of dry powder the conglomerate has ever held.

Everyone can learn a thing or two following his advice and actions.

One of Buffett's best bets has been to buy shares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the dominant consumer-electronics enterprise. Berkshire first purchased the stock in the first quarter of 2016, and since the start of that year, Apple has soared 862% (as of Dec. 17), meaningfully outperforming the S&P 500.

As of this writing, 25% of Berkshire's massive $299 billion portfolio is in Apple, making it its top holding, even after the Oracle of Omaha trimmed the position over the past year. Continue reading to learn what first caught Buffett's attention and if the stock is a smart buy right now.

Favorable characteristics

Nearly a decade ago, just before Buffett and Berkshire first bought a stake in Apple, it was obvious that Apple possessed one of the world's most powerful brands. The company's successful history of developing and bringing to market extremely popular and in-demand hardware devices allowed it to resonate strongly with consumers. That positioning has helped the company flex its pricing power.

Besides Apple's brand, Buffett likely understood that the company had tremendous customer loyalty. Credit partly goes to the brand's image.

However, Apple's ecosystem, which mixes its hardware offerings with a suite of internally developed software and services to provide a superior user experience, essentially locks consumers in, discouraging them to change to competitors' offerings. Buffett even suggested that if you offered someone $10,000 on the condition that they could never use an iPhone again, the deal would be declined -- probably without hesitation. This points to Apple's customer loyalty.

Buffett appreciates businesses that are in sound financial shape, and perhaps no company is as financially fit as Apple. It generates incredible amounts of operating income and free cash flow quarter in and quarter out, allowing management to repurchase shares and pay dividends. As of Sept. 28, Apple had a net cash position of $50 billion, a financial cushion that lets investors sleep well at night.

During the first three months of 2016, Apple shares traded at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 10.6. With the benefit of hindsight, that valuation made the investment opportunity seem like a no-brainer. No wonder Buffett made the decision to buy Apple stock then.

Known primarily for supplying smartphone chips to the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Samsung, shares of Qorvo plunged following the release of the company's fiscal 2025 second-quarter results in October. Though the company's revenue and earnings were higher than Wall Street's expectations, its terrible guidance led investors to press the panic button.

Let's see why that was the case and check if Qorvo can ride the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled smartphones and witness a turnaround in its stock market fortunes next year.

Qorvo may remain under pressure in the near term

Qorvo's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was down 5% year over year to $1.05 billion. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings fell to $1.88 per share from $2.39 per share in the year-ago period, a year-over-year decline of 21%. Analysts would have settled for $1.85 per share in earnings on revenue of $1.03 billion.

However, Qorvo was unable to follow up its better-than-expected results with a strong outlook. The company expects its revenue in the current quarter to land at $900 million, along with adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share. Analysts were looking for $1.06 billion in revenue from Qorvo, along with $1.92 per share in earnings.

So, Qorvo missed Wall Street's fiscal Q3 expectations by a huge margin, leading investors to press the panic button. Moreover, the company is forecasting its fiscal 2025 revenue and gross margin to be slightly lower than fiscal 2024 levels. Qorvo management blamed the shift toward entry-level 5G Android smartphones from mid-tier 5G smartphones for its poor guidance, adding that the company isn't expecting this trend to reverse anytime soon.

The shift toward cheaper smartphone models suggests that Qorvo may be selling lower-margin chips and generating lesser revenue when compared to chips that go into mid-tier smartphones. The company does point out that the demand for flagship and premium smartphones remains solid, but things aren't rosy in the lower tiers.

Qorvo's guidance for the current quarter indicates that its top line is on track to drop by 16% year over year. The bottom line will also take a big hit considering that it reported $2.10 per share in earnings in the year-ago period. Consensus estimates are projecting a 2.5% drop in Qorvo's top line this year to $3.68 billion, while earnings are expected to drop at an alarming pace of 22% in fiscal 2025 to $4.82 per share.

The market is spooked by an inflation-concerned Fed not smashing the pedal down to slash rates and appease bullish investors.

The vibe is not lost on San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly, seen often as a policy dove who's a voting member on the FOMC this year.

""Well, it was a close call, frankly, and it took a lot of deliberation as it often does with myself and my team, and then also with the FOMC participants. Ultimately, I decided that it was appropriate to reduce [interest rates] 25 basis points — that will be 100 basis points of recalibration. And I see that as right-sizing the policy rate level to the economy,"" Daly said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above).

Added Daly, ""So I see the recalibration period now as completed. We now are back to the time we can make our decisions more slowly. Data-dependent, using the data to affect the incoming forecast and, you know, determine how many rate cuts we'll ultimately do next year. We'll have to be agile and data-dependent.""

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. It marked the Fed's third straight rate cut of 2024, which began with a blast — a 50 basis point reduction on Sept. 18.

Daly voted for the reduction in interest rates. The lone dissenting vote — a rarity under the Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve — was newly appointed Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack.

Hammack preferred not to cut interest rates.

""I mean, we might get really positive inflation news and we'll react to that if we do. But I do think that we want to make sure we finish the job,"" said Daly, who noted getting inflation to 2% helps build trust and credibility for the Fed.

""So we are resolute to get that job done and that will mean restricted policy through the year [in 2025] in all likelihood.""

But what spooked a market that has been bidding up Big Tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) with reckless abandon in December was the Fed not committing to aggressive rate cutting in 2025.

The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year, down from the four forecast in September. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possible tariffs on China.

Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company.

• USD (NVDA) View Quote Details

“All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169.

Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025.

Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November.

Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction.

These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030.

Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors.""

It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above).

Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Tencent and TikTok owner ByteDance about integrating their artificial intelligence models into iPhones sold in China, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

• USD (AAPL) View Quote Details

The U.S. company started the rollout of OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices this month, part of the Apple Intelligence product that allows its Siri voice assistant to tap the chatbot's expertise including on user queries about photos and documents such as presentations.

ChatGPT is not available in China and the country's regulatory requirements mandate that generative AI services obtain government approval before public release, forcing Apple to seek local partners for its AI features at a time when its market share in the country is declining.

Apple's discussions with Tencent and ByteDance on using their AI models are at a very early stage, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are not public.

ByteDance declined to comment, while Apple and Tencent did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

A successful partner for Apple's AI services in China could be a major winner in the country's increasingly crowded AI field where dozens of large language models have been launched by large tech firms as well as startups.

They include ByteDance's Doubao, Tencent's Hunyuan and search engine giant Baidu's Ernie.

Market share in China

Apple and Baidu have reportedly been in talks about using the latter's AI model in China, but The Information this month reported the discussions faced setbacks due to technical issues, including disputes over using iPhone user data to train AI models.

Baidu did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Baidu's Hong Kong-listed shares fell after the Reuters report, down 4.2% against a 0.6% decline in the Hang Seng index.. Tencent's shares rose 2.3%.

The absence of AI capabilities in the latest iPhones sold in China has become a major setback for Apple, as it faces declining market share in the world's biggest smartphone market due to growing competition from domestic brands including Huawei.

Huawei, which returned to the high-end market in August with a phone using a Chinese-made chip, launched its Mate 70 series last month featuring AI capabilities powered by its proprietary large language model.

Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter before recovering in the third quarter. The U.S. company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3% during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42%, according to research firm IDC.

We have two consecutive short trading weeks on the way, with Christmas and New Years around the corner. I'm examining the historical data on how stocks tend to perform these weeks. Then I’m going to look at the actual Santa Claus Rally as it was officially defined. Finally, I’ll list some individual stocks to keep an eye on during the most wonderful time of the year.

SPX Returns for Holiday Weeks

The table below summarizes weekly returns for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) over the past 50 years. Certain years, traders don’t get a day off for New Year’s so that’s why there’s less than 50 New Year’s weeks. Buyers seem to stick around on the holidays as these have been bullish weeks for stocks. The SPX averages a 0.55% return during the week of Christmas with 62% of the returns positive. New Year’s has done even better averaging a return of 0.66%. These holiday weeks easily beat the typical weekly return for the SPX of 0.17%.

What to Expect for a Santa Claus Rally

The general outperformance for stocks at the end of year is often casually referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. According to Investopedia, however, the term was first used in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, the founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. He defined the Santa Claus Rally as the first two trading days of the New Year along with the last five trading days of the previous year. So, let’s look at how these specific seven trading days have performed over the past 50 years.

This has indeed been a bullish time. The S&P 500 has averaged a return of more than 1% with positive returns 74% of the time during these seven trading days. The typical 7-day return for the index was 0.26% with 58% of the returns positive.

Individual Stock Performance

This next table lists the S&P 500 stocks which have performed the best during the Santa Claus Rally over the past 10 years (sorted by percent positive then average return). Newmont (NEM) tops the list averaging a return of more than 4% with 90% of the returns positive. I see a few real estate names and healthcare companies, but no sector is dominating the list.

Finally, there have been stocks that underperform during this time. This next table shows the worst performing S&P 500 stocks during the Santa Claus Rally timeframe. CME Group (CME) tops this list, finishing positive just one time out of 10 during these seven trading days. Interestingly, some mega-cap stocks show up on this list including Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL).

As we enter one of the most-positive times of the year for the stock market, from December 19, 2024, until January 2, 2025, we note that the market has not been kind to average stock as well as many sectors since the latter part of November. Some blame it on tax-loss selling, which is probable. But there are sectors and indices falling from all-time highs, or at least 2024 highs, so there can?t be any tax selling there. NYSE breadth on Tuesday was -1,611 as the streak of weak breadth continues. The 12-day NYSE advances/total issues is down to 39%, one of the weakest readings over the past two years.

The major index has fallen for nine straight trading days, its largest stretch of consecutive declines since 1978. The move lower in the Dow comes as large-cap tech has largely been holding up the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) throughout December.

The Dow's losses amount to roughly 3%, or more than 1,500 points, in the past nine trading sessions. The index has fallen from a record close of 45,014 on Dec. 4 to 43,499 as of Tuesday's close. In that same time frame, the S&P 500 is down about 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up almost 2%.

Given the Dow's construction, it's not benefitting from the tech rally. Of the Dow's 30 stocks, just four — Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) — are members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks. This means the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, hasn't benefitted from massive rallies in Tesla (TSLA), which is up more than 37% in the past 10 days, or Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), which has risen 14% in the same time period.

Instead, the Dow has been pulled down, partly due to the recent sell-off in Nvidia stock. The blue-chip index added Nvidia on Nov. 8. Since then, one of the hottest stocks in the market has cooled off, with shares down nearly 12%.

UnitedHealth Group has been the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past 10 days, with shares down nearly 20%. · Source: Yahoo Finance

""It's really the tech leadership versus everything else, value versus growth,"" WisdomTree global chief investment officer Jeremy Schwartz told Yahoo Finance.

A sell-off in healthcare stocks has also weighed on the Dow. UnitedHealth (UNH) is down about 20% in the past 10 days following the murder of its CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4. Other healthcare stocks have also lagged, with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Amgen (AMGN) both down more than 4% in the past 10 trading sessions.

Schwartz said the Dow's decline hasn't been surprising given the run-up in stocks this year, though.

""We are still optimistic for next year. We think stocks versus bonds is still [the place] to be in the markets,"" he said. ""But there was so much strong positioning for this rally and for this seasonal rally that it's not actually a surprise to see this pullback.""

Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) all hit fresh record highs on Monday. Even on a day like Tuesday, where all three major indexes were in the red, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) hit a record high.

While each individual stock has its own potential story working for it — like Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ties with Donald Trump sparking a post-election rally — market strategists believe there is also a broader theme at play: The Magnificent Seven have become a place to hide when the direction of the macro narrative becomes uncertain.

""When you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a 'defensive,'"" Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert said.

• USD (MAGS) View Quote Details

The large-cap bias among investors has come as markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates less than previously anticipated over the next year amid signs of sticky inflation and solid economic growth.

As of Tuesday, markets were pricing in two interest rate cuts for 2025, one fewer than markets projected prior to the presidential election on Nov. 5 and a far cry from the four that Federal Reserve officials initially favored in their most recent Summary of Economic Projections release in September.

Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that when you consider the market is pricing in fewer interest rate cuts, a Magnificent Seven rally ""isn't a coincidence.""

""If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario,"" Gordon said while noting that the Magnificent Seven stocks fit that description.

Gordon pointed out that the Magnificent Seven, as well as other large-cap companies, fit the bill for a flight to safety amid rate uncertainty because they have significant cash on their balance sheets and strong quarterly cash flow. As Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith back in April, this likely protects Big Tech from being exposed to high borrowing costs that could persist if the Fed pauses interest rate cuts.

Shares of the AI chipmaker were down roughly 14% from its record high closing price of $148.88 in early November.

• USD (NVDA) View Quote Details

Nvidia made a swift ascent to the top, from a graphics card company primarily used for video games to the world’s leading supplier of AI chips, as Big Tech goes all-in on generative artificial intelligence. In 2024, it has traded places with Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable company, and in early November, it replaced the once-dominant Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note last week he expects Nvidia’s market cap to surpass $4 trillion in 2025.

But following its record close in November, Nvidia shares began to fall after commentary from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. Rumors of overheating with its latest Blackwell AI servers stoked fears of further delays to the production ramp up, sending shares down even more. Even Nvidia’s most recent blowout earnings report, which surpassed bullish analysts’ already-high expectations, did little to help the stock's trajectory.

Adding to Nvidia’s troubles, China’s competition authority last week said it has launched an antitrust probe into Nvidia’s $7 billion acquisition of networking technology company Mellanox.

Meanwhile, the competition is heating up. Amazon (AMZN) in early December said it’s building a supercomputer with its new servers and its own Trainium AI chips — which it’s hoping can become a viable alternative to Nvidia. Broadcom (AVGO) said in its most recent earnings report that deals with hyperscalers to supply its custom AI chips called XPUs will bring in as much as $90 billion over the next three years — sending the stock soaring and Nvidia’s in the opposite direction, despite analyst commentary that Broadcom’s success won’t come at Nvidia’s expense.

Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums despite concerns that companies have yet to see a meaningful return on their investments. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. At the same time, only 4% of US workers actually use AI daily, according to a recent Gallup poll cited by Bloomberg.

Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) market capitalization has grown from $360 billion to $3.3 trillion, almost entirely because of soaring sales of its AI data center chips.

But the industry is evolving fast, so picking the long-term winners and losers won't be easy. That's why buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds several different AI stocks could be the best strategy for investors. It can offer exposure to the value created by AI in a diversified manner, which can insulate investors from severe losses if some companies fail.

The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) holds practically every top AI stock (including Nvidia), so here's why it might be one of the best choices for investors of all experience levels.

Several popular AI stocks packaged into one ETF

The iShares exchange-traded fund (ETF) has a relatively broad portfolio featuring 276 stocks. That's because it isn't specifically an AI fund -- its objective is to invest across the technology sector overall, in addition to the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. It just so happens that many of the largest companies in those market segments are laser focused on developing AI.

Despite holding hundreds of stocks, the iShares ETF is very concentrated. Its top three positions alone account for 25.3% of the value of its entire portfolio:

Stock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 8.73% 2. Nvidia 8.33% 3. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) 8.24%

Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 16, 2024, and are subject to change.

Meta, Nvidia, and Apple could be three of the most important names in AI over the long term. Meta created the world's most popular open-source large language model (LLM), called Llama, which has been downloaded more than 600 million times. The company is using it to create AI features for Facebook and Instagram, but Llama also provides businesses and developers with a cost effective way to create AI software.

Meta plans to launch Llama 4 next year, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg says could be the most advanced LLM in the entire AI industry. That would be an incredible accomplishment since many other companies (like OpenAI) had a head start of several years.

Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center are the most advanced in the industry for developing AI. The company just started shipping its new Blackwell chips, which offer a significant performance boost compared to its flagship H100, and sales are expected to ramp up extremely fast. That's why I think Nvidia could be one of the best performing stocks in the tech sector next year.

Since ascending to the role as CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,561,176%, as of the closing bell on Dec. 12, and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.

Vastly outperforming Wall Street's most-followed stock index has earned the Oracle of Omaha quite the following. It's why investors eagerly await Berkshire's Form 13F filings each quarter so they can see which stocks Buffett has been buying and selling.

While Berkshire's chief has historically invested in businesses with sustainable moats and strong management teams, perhaps the most-defining characteristic of Buffett's investing philosophy is his penchant for concentration. He believes his best ideas are worthy of an outsized investment.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.

As we ready to turn the page to a new year, Warren Buffett appears poised to enter 2025 with 66% ($199.1 billion) of the $301 billion portfolio he oversees at Berkshire Hathaway invested in the following five unstoppable stocks.

Apple: $74.4 billion (24.7% of invested assets)

Though tech goliath Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the largest holding at Berkshire by a considerable amount, it's worth noting that Buffett has overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock, in aggregate, over the previous four quarters, ended Sept. 30.

During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett opined that tax purposes were behind the recent selling activity. He intimated that the corporate income tax rate was likely to climb, which would make locking in sizable unrealized gains at a favorably low corporate income tax rate a smart move.

In hindsight, this hasn't worked at as planned. With Donald Trump winning in November, the corporate income tax is likely to remain at its lowest level since 1939, or perhaps head even lower.

Despite paring down two-thirds of Berkshire's stake in Apple, Warren Buffett continues to appreciate consumers' love for the Apple brand, as well as Tim Cook's top-notch leadership. Cook is overseeing an ongoing transformation that has his company focused on higher-margin subscription services.

Additionally, Buffett is a huge fan of hearty capital-return programs. On top of Apple dishing out $1 per share in dividends each year -- Berkshire is on track to collect $300 million in dividend income from its Apple stake in 2025 -- it has the largest share repurchase program on the planet. It's bought back $700.6 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Apple shares have risen about 29% so far this year. The iPhone maker impressed investors with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.64, with sales rising 6% to $94.9 billion. Notably, revenue from iPhone, which accounted for about 49% of the overall sales, grew 5.5% to $46.2 billion.

Moreover, revenue from Services, which is a higher-margin business compared to Apple’s products, grew 12% to about $25 billion. Apple expects its Services revenue growth in the December quarter to be nearly the same as its growth rate in the past year (12.9%). Further, the company expects its December overall sales to rise by “low to mid-single digit.”

While there are concerns about the impact of competition on iPhone sales in key markets like China, several analysts remain confident about the company due to its growing Services business and AI initiatives like Apple Intelligence.

Is AAPL a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Baird analyst William Power raised the price target for Apple stock to $260 from $240 while reiterating a Buy rating. Power noted that AAPL currently trades at 32.8x of the calendar year 2025 EPS estimate, reflecting about a 50% premium to the S&P 500’s (SPX) multiple of 22x.

He added that his $260 target price is based on a 34x P/E multiple (calculated on 2025 EPS forecast), placing it towards the high end of the stock’s 10-35x historical range and a premium to other tech and consumer leaders. Power explained that the premium valuation reflects solid execution, growing contribution from Services, continued eco-system benefits, and impressive free cash flow.

With 20 Buys, nine Holds, and two Sells, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Apple stock. The average AAPL stock price target of $243.20 implies 2% downside risk.

The high demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell chip, which is 25 times more efficient at consuming energy than the H100, means the Danish bank believes the stock could potentially reach $250 per share. If Nvidia can live up to that, its market cap would be $6.2 trillion, double Apple's current worth.

The rising cost of energy to run data centrs, which is causing the AI arms race to intensify, has fuelled insatiable demand for Nvidia cutting edge chips which is satiating it for becoming the most profitable company ever. It's also set to achieve stronger earnings per share, with sales forecast to rise from $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024 at $195 billion by 2026.

In addition, Nvidia's grip on AI, with its graphics chips powering 90% of AI systems and the Omniverse platform, which sells to businesses, puts it ahead of rivals such as Apple. Analysts support Nvidia at 31 times future earnings, with 36 of 43, giving it a 'Strong Buy' and a potential upside of 25%.

Such a strong growth outlook puts Nvidia in a position to continue on its ascent in 2025, disrupting the tech market and reshaping how AI innovation takes shape.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company expects its custom AI chips will generate between $60 billion and $90 billion in revenue over the next three years from its three existing hyperscaler customers, whom the company did not name. Tan reiterated his belief that each of the three hyperscalers will deploy 1 million clusters of its custom AI chips called XPUs by 2025.

• USD (AVGO) View Quote Details

Broadcom also confirmed that it has added two more hyperscaler customers who are “in advanced development for their own next-generation AI XPUs,” which could generate further revenue. Media reports, citing anonymous sources, have indicated those new customers could be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL).

""We see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive,"" Tan said in the call with investors Thursday evening.

Broadcom's gain Friday put it up roughly 98% for the year, pushed its share price to an all-time high of $221, and rocketed its market cap past the $1 trillion mark.

Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server chip, according to The Information. The move by tech giants to make their own server chips is meant to cut costs and scale back their reliance on Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs (graphics processing units). OpenAI is reportedly making a similar move in partnership with Broadcom, according to Reuters and Bloomberg.

Broadcom makes custom chips for data centers, consumer electronics like smartphones and laptops, and electric vehicles. The company has expanded to making enterprise software with partnerships with Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG).

Still, concern exists that Big Tech may not be able to sustain its spending on AI infrastructure if it cannot meaningfully monetize the new technology. OpenAI suffered roughly $5 billion in losses in 2024. And only 4% of US workers actually use AI daily, according to a recent Gallup poll cited by Bloomberg.

Broadcom’s opportunity in the AI chip space is not mirrored in the other parts of its semiconductor business. Overall, in its fourth quarter, semiconductor revenue grew 12% from last year to $8.2 billion. That masked a divergence between its AI chips and non-AI chips, though. AI chip sales grew a strong 150% to $3.7 billion, while non-AI semiconductor revenue declined 23% to $4.5 billion.

The investment conglomerate has a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, and it currently ranks as the world's 10th most valuable company.

In addition to its collection of partly and fully owned private subsidiaries, Buffett's company owns a portfolio of publicly traded stocks that's currently worth $300.5 billion. Investors who dive into the breakdown of Berkshire's portfolio may notice that the portfolio is actually heavily concentrated around a relatively small number of holdings. Those who dig a bit deeper might also notice that each of Berkshire's 10 largest stock holdings pays a dividend.

So while Berkshire itself doesn't pay a dividend, it's clear that Buffett's company prefers high-quality businesses that can reliably return cash to shareholders through direct payments. Read on for a look at two S&P 500 stocks that account for 39.5% of the investment conglomerate's stock portfolio.

The dividend is small, but this stock is still Buffett's biggest bet

Keith Noonan: With a market cap of roughly $3.67 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stands as the world's most valuable company. It didn't reach that position by accident. The tech giant has frequently ranked as the world's most profitable business over the last decade, and impressive earnings growth has translated to stellar performance for the company and its stock.

The company's iPhone line is at the center of Apple's profit-generating machine, and its hardware typically accounts for the majority of overall global smartphone sales revenue, despite many other players operating in the space. The iPhone's stellar brand strength and loyal user base allow Apple to command average selling prices that far surpass the competition, and the company captures the large majority of global smartphone operating profits. In addition to dominating the mobile space, Apple sees strong performance from software and services, wearables, and other categories.

Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Apple stock in the first quarter of 2016. The Oracle of Omaha's company dramatically increased its investments in the tech leader as profits continued to soar. Despite it sporting a relatively small dividend yield, Berkshire's heavy investment in the stock meant that Apple has been one of its biggest generators of dividend income over the last decade.

Even as Berkshire has made some significant shifts in its portfolio composition, Apple continues to account for 24.2% of the investment conglomerate's total stock holdings. While the stock pays an annual dividend of $1 per share and only yields roughly 0.4% at today's prices, Berkshire's holdings of 300 million shares mean that it would be on track to generate $300 million in dividend income over the next year if it maintained its Apple position at current levels. But recent moves from Buffett's company suggest that its dividend proceeds on the stock could wind up being lower.

But a few billionaire-led hedge funds sold Apple and bought Tesla during the third quarter. Here are the details.

Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 11.5 million shares of Apple, reducing his stake by 90%. Apple had been one of his 10 largest holdings, but it no longer ranks in the top 50. Meanwhile, Englander bought 225,760 shares of Tesla, increasing his position by 51%.

Louis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 431,000 shares of Apple, exiting his position entirely. Apple had been one of his 10 largest holdings. Meanwhile, Bacon bought 25,000 shares of Tesla, which now ranks among his top 25 holdings.

Dan Loeb of Third Point sold 1 million shares of Apple, reducing his take by 52%. Apple had been the seventh-largest position in the portfolio, but it no longer ranks among the top 10. Meanwhile, Loeb bought 400,000 shares of Tesla, opening a new position

The trades above are detailed in the latest Forms 13F completed by each hedge fund. While those forms were filed recently, the trades took place at least two months ago. So, here is a more up-to-date look at Apple and Tesla.

1. Apple

Apple has cultivated brand authority and pricing power by developing a ecosystem of tightly integrated hardware, software, and services. The company has a strong presence in consumer electronics categories like smartphones and personal computers, as well as adjacent markets like financial services, streaming media, and mobile app distribution and advertising.

However, Apple is beset by headwinds. For instance, vertical integration of hardware and services has traditionally been a competitive advantage for the company. But the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe has weakened that advantage by forcing Apple to permit third-party app stores on its devices, and to allow alternative in-app payment methods. Similar legislation has been introduced in the U.S., which could be problematic for Apple if implemented.

Additionally, Apple's services business is driven in large part by Alphabet. Apple receives up to $20 billion annually for making Google the default search engine on its devices, but that revenue could disappear. Federal Judge Amit Mehta recently ruled that Alphabet had an illegal monopoly in internet search. The appeals process may last years, but Alphabet's ability to pay for default search placement will likely be limited, if not completely prohibited.

Finally, some analysts have framed the introduction of Apple Intelligence -- a suite of artificial intelligence features for its devices -- as the catalyst for an iPhone upgrade cycle of epic proportions. However, those expectations not only seem overbaked, but also have been priced into the stock several times over.

In focus was fresh inflation data, which helped cast doubt on investor confidence for the path of interest rates ahead.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were both about 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 0.6% while shares of Apple (AAPL) rallied less than 1% to close at a record high.

In bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added 5 basis points to hit 4.32%, its highest closing level since Nov. 22.

The in-line consumer price index reading cleared one of the last remaining risks to easing by the Fed in December. That boosted bets on a quarter-point rate cut in December to a near 99% chance, per the CME FedWatch tool.

But the November producer price index released on Thursday morning came in hotter than expected, rising 0.4% from the previous month. Economists had been expecting an increase of 0.2%. That has put the chances of the Fed holding rates steady in January in focus, as several officials have voiced a cautious stance on policy.

A downbeat revenue forecast from Adobe (ADBE) also helped dampen the mood, revealing the Photoshop maker's struggle for a payoff from its AI investments. Shares in the software maker sank nearly 14%.

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The challenges of developing an autonomous fleet have put another corporate victim into the barriers and out of the race.

GM's (GM) Cruise robotaxi business is out.

An admission that billions of dollars and years of toiling aren't enough to sustain what is still a commercial fantasy. But where an old-school car company has faltered, a sprawling tech giant (Alphabet) and an EV company with ascendent political backing (Tesla) are going all in.

In racing terms, the stage race is ongoing and we've finished the first stage. We're starting to see some winners like Waymo and some losers like Cruise.

• USD (GM) View Quote Details

Cruise isn't even the first major player to bow out of the race to develop a robotaxi business. Ford (F) ended its Argo AI self-driving venture two years ago. And Apple (AAPL), wavering between building an autonomous fleet or merely a new EV, scrapped its decade-long car project altogether earlier this year.

At first glance, Cruise's demise looks like a boon to its robotaxi rival, Waymo, Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) sister company. And great news for Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA), which is planning to spin out its own robotaxi by 2027. But there’s a doubled-edged dynamic at play.

On the one hand, there's now one fewer competitor around. On the other hand, the end of Cruise is also more evidence that even established players can’t hack it.

GM's market cap is very different from Alphabet's and Tesla's. Maybe their trillion-dollar valuations give them the resources and time to tinker that GM decided it didn't have. But it's not an encouraging signal.

It may seem that Cruise's downfall was tied up in the particular tragedy of the high-profile pedestrian accident last year, leading the company to temporarily halt its service, from which it never really recovered. While that's strictly true, the particulars of the incident can be generalized and applied to any autonomous contender: There are massive investment costs and huge risks to pushing the technological frontier.

If it's still unclear whether this is the type of market where many players can thrive — perhaps catering to the different segments of a big country with lots of different cars — the end of Cruise, as well as Uber's reliance on fickle partnerships, hints at something closer to one or two players that win and take all.",en,neutral,0.9997026324272156
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-5-000-might-want-092300826.html,finance.yahoo.com,"Got $5,000? You Might Want to Buy These 3 Unstoppable Stocks",,2024-12-12T09:23:00.000Z,"A $5,000 investment can grow significantly when you put that money into an unstoppable stock and hang on to it for the long term. It's a strategy that can make a lot of sense for long-term investors, as finding a solid company to invest in and simply remaining patient can result in your money doubling or tripling in value or perhaps even growing to more than that.

An unstoppable stock is one that has a promising trajectory ahead where there's little doubt about its future growth opportunities. This is the type of investment where the company is also equipped with strong resources and fundamentals, allowing it to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the future.

Three unstoppable stocks that can be safe options for investors to build their portfolios around right now include Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST).

1. Walmart

Big-box retailer Walmart has been a top name in both retail and e-commerce for years. However, the business is still flush with growth opportunities. Although it has generated more than $665 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, Walmart has over 10,500 stores and clubs and is in just 19 countries throughout the world -- there's plenty of room for more global expansion in the future.

Another big opportunity for the business is in e-commerce, where Walmart has been taking on Amazon in recent years. With the launch of its Walmart+ subscription in 2020, which offers many benefits and unique savings similar to Amazon's Prime, this is an area that can pave the way for more growth for Walmart in the years to come. As of the end of this year, eMarketer projects that there will be 32 million Walmart+ subscribers, which is still far below the more than 180 million Amazon Prime subscribers in the U.S.

Walmart has a lot of room to grow even though it is already a massive business. At around 40 times earnings, investors are paying a bit of a premium to own the stock, but if you plan to hang on for several years, it can still be an excellent investment to put in your portfolio and forget about.

2. Apple

Another fantastic business to invest in for years and maybe even decades is Apple. The company has built up a vast ecosystem of products and services over the years, which makes a customer acquisition particularly valuable for Apple since not only may they upgrade an iPhone or buy an iPad, but there are also many services such as music, news, games, and others that consumers can subscribe to.

Globally, there are around 1.5 billion active iPhone users. Even if Apple doesn't drastically grow this number in the future, the potential it has to grow its services and upsell its loyal fanbase onto new products and services can unlock some tremendous growth opportunities for the company in the years to come. Apple Intelligence, for example, is still in its early stages, and it can provide consumers with artificial intelligence (AI) features that can help make their lives easier. AI has enabled many businesses to enhance their products and services, and Apple may still get a significant boost from that down the road.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%.

Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade.

Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December.

The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations.

On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month.

Key Takeaways

Apple shares may remain on watchlists Tuesday after setting a new all-time high yesterday and registering their 21st record close of the year.

The stock broke out from a five-month ascending triangle earlier this month, signaling a continuation of the iPhone maker's longer-term uptrend.

The measuring principle, which calculates the depth of the ascending triangle near its widest section and adds that amount to the pattern’s top trendline, projects a price target of $278.

Investors should watch key support levels on Apple's chart around $237, $218, and $197.







Apple (AAPL) shares could remain on watchlists Tuesday after setting a new all-time high (ATH) yesterday and registering their 21st record close of the year.

Sentiment surrounding the stock may have received a boost after Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" in a recent interview that the iPhone maker sits well positioned to benefit from a multi-year cycle of product launches, adding that the company’s integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT provides potential revenue opportunities through pro-version upgrades.

Apple shares traded sideways for most of the third quarter as investors digested the delayed rollout of the tech giant’s highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features and its impact on device sales. However, the stock has regained its upward trajectory, rallying more than 12% from its early November low and trading 28% higher since the start of the year as of Monday’s close.

Below a take a closer look at the technicals on Apple’s chart and identify key price levels that investors may be watching out for.

Ascending Triangle Signals Bullish Continuation

Apple shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle earlier this month, signaling a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend.

The stock has continued to move higher, albeit on lackluster volume, with the price completing a bullish engulfing pattern as it set a fresh record high in Monday’s trading session.

While the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could lead to near-term profit taking.

Let’s apply technical analysis to project where the stock’s price may be headed next if the current continuation move plays out and also identify three key support levels that could attract buying interest during retracements.

Chart-Based Price Target to Watch

Investors can project a potential bullish price target by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyses chart patterns to predict future moves.

U.S. stock futures are little changed after markets stepped back from record highs on tech sector jitters; GameStop (GME) reports earnings after markets close today; Oracle (ORCL) shares drop as the tech firm’s revenue comes in lower than expected; European regulators reportedly are seeking information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google on its advertising program targeting teens on Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posts strong November sales, showing that AI demand remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. Here's what investors need to know today.

1. US Stock Futures Flat After Indexes Decline Monday

U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes began the week on a down note, due in part to weakness in the tech sector. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking higher, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are pointing marginally lower. Investors are preparing to digest more earnings reports today and watching for inflation data later this week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $97,000, while gold futures are 0.6% higher. Oil futures are 0.5% lower and yields on the 10-year Treasury note are slightly higher at above 4.2%.

2. GameStop to Report Q3 Results After Bell

GameStop (GME) shares are edging lower in premarket trading ahead of the video game retailer's third-quarter earnings report after markets close today. The report comes after the stock briefly surged last week after a cryptic social media post by meme-stock hero Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill evidently inspired some investors to buy in. GameStop stock is not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, with the one analyst tracked by Visible Alpha giving it an ""underperform"" rating and $10 price target, well below the $27.93 price shares closed at on Monday.

3. Oracle Stock Sinks on Lower-Than-Expected Revenue

Oracle (ORCL) stock is sinking 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations. The cloud services giant, whose shares hit record highs last week on enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) demand, reported revenue of $14.06 billion, up 9% year-over-year but below Visible Alpha estimates. Net income of $3.15 billion or $1.10 per share, up from $2.5 billion or 89 cents per share a year earlier, beat estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 slightly missed expectations.

4. European Regulators Reportedly Probe Google Over Teen-Targeted Ads

European regulators are seeking more information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google about the secret advertising partnership the search giant had with Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META), the Financial Times reported. The deal, which has since been ended, targeted Instagram advertisements to teenagers on YouTube, circumventing Google's rules barring personalized ads to those under 18. Shares of both Alphabet and Meta Platforms are higher in premarket trading.

As we have said before, December is the trickiest month to trade. Should one sell big winners and pay capital-gains tax or wait until early in the next year? Or sell some losers to offset capital gains? If a portfolio is behind, what can be done to catch up? These questions are asked every December. One option is to fade break-outs (some are working, like AAPL) and buy break-downs. That is basically the opposite of what is usually done during the other 11 months of a bull-market year. At the end of a good year, portfolio managers and RIAs ""can't"" sell a certain stock if it's up 100% and subject to large capital-gains taxes. While these big gains can be offset a bit by tax-loss harvesting, many just hold big winners until the next year. Other recognize that the purpose of the investment game is to make big money -- and if that means taxes must be paid, then the job was well done. We mention this because some of 2024's biggest winners and recent market stars were taken to the woodshed on Monday. It appears many thought it was better to take a 100% gain and pay capital-gains taxes -- and not possibly end up with a 50% gain but a smaller tax obligation.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, showing that demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips remains strong.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, showing that demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips remains strong.

The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion). Still, the sales numbers were down 12% from October's figures.

However, revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year to NT$2.62 trillion.

November Sales Jump Comes After CEO Called AI Demand 'Real'

The numbers come after TSMC in October projected a buoyant outlook, with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei calling the demand for AI ""real"" in the third-quarter earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.

Tech companies have dramatically increased their spending on AI infrastructure this year as they've raced to satisfy surging demand for the emerging technology as well as cloud computing, but investors have been worried that the huge investments may not pay off.

U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin sits down with Asking for a Trend Anchor Josh Lipton to talk about how the new iOS update could impact iPhone demands and sales.

""I think the super cycle term gets thrown around,"" says Bajarin. ""I mean, I'm just still of the strong conviction that hardware changes, design changes drive those super cycles, not software. I do still think this is going to be a stronger-than-normal upgrade cycle only because we've known that this is an aging base.""

Bajarin went out to talk about the partnership between Apple and Sam Altman's OpenAI, the company that develops ChatGPT.

""I think OpenAI, they're not Google. In no way, shape, or form are they brand-recognized or used as much as Google,"" says Bajarin. ""So you could see the differences of this deal between a Google for search and ChatGPT and OpenAI for other features.""

Apple is a mature business

It has been 17 years since Apple first released the iPhone, which might be the single greatest product launch ever. This device remains the key financial driver for the overall company, representing 51% of Apple's total sales in fiscal 2024.

On the one hand, the success of the iPhone means that Apple has broad distribution. The business is quite literally in the hands and pockets of consumers across the globe, which is the envy of any company. Apple successfully uses this distribution to push its various software and services, creating a fast-growing, high-margin, and recurring revenue stream.

On the other hand, because the iPhone is now in a much later stage of its lifecycle, it's simply not able to introduce new game-changing features that get consumers excited. Going from zero to one its revolutionary, but moving from 15 to 16, for example, can be a marginal change.

This doesn't boost demand for Apple that can move the needle in a big way. The company's total revenue in fiscal 2024 was 2% higher than the year before. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI initiatives, perhaps there could be a major bump-up in consumer demand to buy the latest version of the iPhone.

Regardless of what the latest trends reveal, Apple's growth prospects remain muted. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company is projected to increase revenue at a compound annual rate of 7% over the next three fiscal years. That's not a lot to get excited about.

Expectations and predictions

There's no denying that Apple has been a moneymaking machine this century, compounding shareholder capital in tremendous fashion. But what are the stock's prospects over the next 12 months?

It doesn't help investors that Apple currently trades at a steep valuation. the stock sells at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. The valuation has rarely been higher in the past 15 years. And the current P/E multiple represents a 100% premium to the average since December 2009. Things are expensive, particularly in light of Apple's soft growth prospects.

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

You cannot pin all the credit on Apple (AAPL) for the surging stock prices this year for AT&T (T) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

I would actually argue Apple deserves none of the credit. Sorry, not sorry, Tim Cook!

Who deserves the credit? The top brass at each company that have been focused on running more beastly telecom operations. I am talking about a maniacal focus on profit margins, free cash flow generation, and expansion of potentially lucrative opportunities. And in turn, there has been zero focus on doing dumb things with shareholder money like expanding into the media business.

First up in this analytical drill-down is Dallas, Texas-based AT&T, led by company veteran John Stankey.

At an investor day this week, Stankey used his trademark deep voice (see video above) to outline more than $40 billion to be returned to shareholders over the next three years via stock buybacks and dividends. What really caught my attention was the guidance for double-digit percentage earnings growth in 2027.

AT&T and double-digit earnings growth normally aren't heard in the same sentence.

Execs are betting that investments in 5G infrastructure and fiber will yield a quicker pace of sales and earnings growth than seen in 2024.

For Stankey, the year-end investor day capped his continued efforts to pivot back to simply being a telecom giant.

In April 2022, AT&T closed its deal to spin off its WarnerMedia division, which it had purchased for a colossal $85 billion just three years earlier. The move combined WarnerMedia's HBO and CNN with Discovery's HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC.

The deal has been a full-on disaster for CEO David Zaslav who leads the now Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

Since the spin-off, AT&T has zeroed in on reducing debt, partly from the WarnerMedia acquisition. In September, AT&T sold its majority stake in TV provider DirecTV to private equity firm TPG for $7.6 billion.

AT&T's long-term debt now stands at $126 billion, down from more than $128 billion in 2022.

""I can say that we are back in growth mode,"" Stankey told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. ""I think we're early innings in our success story, so I don't think it's mission accomplished.""

Stankey added he's bullish on the Trump administration providing tailwinds to his business, especially if tax cuts are extended.",en,neutral,0.8189651966094971

Amazon

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is first on this list. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in May 1997, the business has seen its shares soar 222,600% (as of Dec. 5). That gain turned $1,000 into more than $2.2 million today.

The company started out disrupting the retail sector, leading to its current leading position in the e-commerce niche. Nearly 38% of all spending online in the U.S. happens on Amazon.com, indicative of the business's dominance.

However, Amazon benefits from other powerful secular trends. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, has a leading market share, raking in trailing-12-month revenue of $103 billion. The company also has a popular streaming service in Prime Video, and a large presence in digital advertising.

Amazon is winning over investors by focusing more on the bottom line. During the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, it generated $17.4 billion in operating income, which was up 55% year over year. The leadership team has focused relentlessly on cost cuts and operational efficiency. Wall Street analysts see operating income soaring at a yearly rate of 38.9% between 2023 and 2026.

Shares might be at all-time highs, but investors are still being presented with a nice buying opportunity. The current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.1 is reasonable, given the company's impressive earnings trajectory.

Apple

With a current market cap of just under $3.7 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been the world's most valuable company. This has come about thanks to a stock that has generated a 245,800% total return since December 1980, turning $1,000 into just under $2.5 million right now.

Apple has become a consumer electronics juggernaut by providing its users with beautifully designed hardware products that come equipped with the company's internal software capabilities. Innovation has been key to Apple's success, as it's developed extremely popular products over the years, like the iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods.

The Oracle of Omaha has sold a total of $133 billion worth of equities from Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio through the first nine months of 2024.

Some of the biggest sales include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), of which he sold more than two-thirds of Berkshire's stake, and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Despite the sales, Berkshire still holds $300 billion in stock, but only a handful of companies are safe from getting a trim these days, it seems.

Many see Buffett's massive stock sales as a big warning for investors that the stock market is overpriced and investors should reduce their exposure to equities. Indeed, Buffett's Apple and Bank of America sales suggest he thinks both stocks currently trade near or above their intrinsic values. Investors will be hard-pressed to earn solid returns buying stocks above their actual value, so it may be smart to trim positions like Apple or Bank of America.

But Buffett doesn't think every stock is overpriced right now. It's just that he faces a unique challenge as someone in charge of managing $600 billion in assets when you include Berkshire's cash and Treasury bill positions. His stock purchases this year tell the whole story.

This small $550 million purchase speaks volumes

Berkshire's biggest equity purchase during the third quarter was about $550 million worth of Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ). Yes, it pales in comparison to the $36 billion Buffett and his team sold in other stocks during the quarter, and the purchase accounts for just 0.2% of the entire equity portfolio. But the purchase accounts for 3.7% of the entire pizza purveyor.

Domino's may be a great stock to buy. Its fortressing strategy has enabled it to grow its market share around the world. It's showing strong profitability at the store level even as it cannibalizes itself by opening new locations near existing ones. It's producing strong operating margin expansion and is returning capital to shareholders. These are all signs of a great company.

Buffett's challenge is that Domino's market cap is currently less than $16 billion as of this writing. He could buy 20 companies the size of Domino's Pizza with Berkshire's cash pile if the market would let him.

He has run into similar problems with other stocks he found attractive in 2024: Ulta Beauty has a market cap of about $17 billion, Sirius XM has a market cap of about $9 billion, Pool Corp has a market cap around $14 billion, and Heico has a market cap of $32 billion. The market constrains how much of those stocks Buffett can actually buy.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

• USD (NVDA) View Quote Details

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

By comparison, the S&P 500's cumulative return over that time was just 31,223%.

Buffett has overseen the growth of Berkshire's investable assets, reaching well over $600 billion today. But Buffett hasn't seen a lot to like in the stock market recently. In fact, he's made some big sales of two of Berkshire's largest stock holdings in recent quarters, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).

Here's what investors need to know.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

$133 billion of sales in 2024 (so far)

Buffett (through Berkshire) sold off $133 billion worth of stock through the first nine months of 2024.

The bulk of that was Apple stock. Berkshire held 905.6 million shares of Apple at the start of the year. The stock made up nearly half of the entire equity portfolio Buffett and his team managed. But Buffett has significantly cut down on that position so far this year.

He sold 116 million shares in the first quarter, 389 million shares in the second quarter, and 100 million shares in the third quarter. The entire stake stands at 300 million shares today. That said, those shares are worth about $70 billion, as of this writing, accounting for over 23% of Berkshire's entire equity portfolio. That means Apple is still Berkshire's largest equity position. Buffett said it's extremely likely Apple will be the largest common stock holding in Berkshire's portfolio at the end of the year during Berkshire's shareholder meeting in May.

There's a chance Buffett will continue selling off Berkshire's stake in Apple during the fourth quarter, though. Shares hit a new all-time high in October, and continue to trade around that level as of this writing.

Buffett has also turned his attention to Berkshire's stake in Bank of America recently. Between July and October, Berkshire sold at least $10.5 billion worth of shares in the bank stock. Berkshire's stake in the company fell below 10% as a result of the sales, so investors will have to wait until Berkshire's next earnings report and 13F filing to see if Buffett continued to trim the position. Considering the stock currently trades at a price higher than every previous sale from Berkshire, there's a good chance Buffett continued selling.

I'm not saying that the iPhone will go out of style and send Apple's stock tumbling down the rankings over the next decade. However, I could definitely imagine a couple of currently smaller names becoming more valuable than Cupertino's finest in 10 years or so. Read on to see why I expect Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to wrest away Apple's market cap crown over time.

Why Apple might lose its market crown

First of all, I have to assume that Apple's record-setting stock gains will slow down in the coming years. Otherwise, Amazon and Alphabet would have a hard time catching up. They are starting several steps behind the current leader, after all:

Tech Giant Market Cap 5-year Market Cap Change Apple $3.54 trillion 203% Amazon $2.10 trillion 145% Alphabet $2.03 trillion 130%

Data found on YCharts and Finviz, 11/25/24.

Apple didn't find its leading market position in a cereal box. Despite faltering sales of iPhones and iPads, the company maintained a solid foundation of hardware sales paired with soaring software and service revenues in recent years. This trio has stayed fairly close since 2020, but Apple always seems to find a way back up.

My mildly bearish thesis is that Apple is running out of truly innovative ideas. I know, you've heard it all before -- iPads are just larger iPhones without a phone service, the lucrative Apple ecosystem is bad for the customer, high prices don't always reflect superior products, and so on. Apple bears have been saying this stuff for years, but guess who's still the most valuable company in the world?

Still, Apple has seen more misses than home runs lately. The Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset never found a market and is reportedly being discontinued after less than a year. The latest round of product introductions essentially featured slightly faster iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads with more memory. Only time will tell whether the highly touted Apple Intelligence set of artificial intelligence (AI) features will make a difference. Either way, Apple didn't lead the charge into the generative AI era.

Englander either added to or reduced Millennium's positions in many of its holdings in the third quarter of 2024. Some of his most notable trades involved buying and selling ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.

Not so magnificent?

Buffett trimmed Berkshire's position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) by 25% in Q3. Englander made an even more emphatic move, slashing Millennium's stake in the iPhone maker by a whopping 90.4%. However, the hedge fund didn't completely exit its position with Apple. It still owns 1.22 million shares worth around $285 million at the end of Q3.

Englander hasn't explained publicly his rationale for selling most of his shares of Apple. Perhaps he decided to ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" with the company's launch of its new generative AI functionality. Notably, though, his hedge fund increased the number of call and put options that it owns for Apple.

Millennium drastically reduced its position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 as well. It sold 86.9% of its stake in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. This was perhaps a surprising move considering Amazon's marked improvement in profitability and free cash flow in recent quarters.

Englander didn't take the axe as heavily to Millennium's stake in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). He sold 1.6 million shares of the chipmaker, reducing his fund's position by roughly 12.6%. Nvidia still ranked as his fourth-largest holding at the end of Q3, though.

Why sell Nvidia? My hunch is that Englander was simply taking some profits off the table. However, he perhaps could have been concerned about the reported delays in Nvidia's shipments of new GPUs based on its powerful Blackwell architecture.

Buying mode

Englander loaded up on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) during Q3. He bought 1.56 million additional shares of the tech giant, boosting Millennium's stake by 51.4%. Microsoft ranked as the hedge fund's third-largest holding at the end of the quarter.

He also added modestly to Millennium's position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) in Q3. The hedge fund owned 1.34 million shares at the end of the quarter, up 7.6% from three months earlier.

The expert explains that ""the best remedy,"" in his view, would be to ""address what the judge saw as a competitive problem, without having potentially unintended consequences for other parts of the market, would be to restrict the ability of Google to enter those types of contracts.""

""The problem here is that those contracts involve Google paying billions and billions of dollars to other companies, such as Apple (AAPL) and Mozilla... And one assumes that there's a group of [companies] who would like to keep receiving that money from Google and have been trying to think of other remedies that we could get.""

In his nearly six decades as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), the aptly dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of greater than 5,660,000%, as of the closing bell on Nov. 14.

Buffett's ability to consistently outperform Wall Street's major indexes over lengthy timelines has some investors eager to ride his coattails. Thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this can be done with relative ease.

A 13F is a required filing by institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides investors with a snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Nov. 14 was the filing deadline to disclose trading activity for the September-ended quarter.

Consistent with Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs over the last two years, Buffett and his team have been net sellers of equities and very selective buyers. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, one top holding continues to get the heave-ho, while another beloved consumer goods brand is suddenly a popular buy.

Shares of Berkshire's top holding continue to be shown to the door

Based on Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated cash flow statements, Buffett and his team have sold more stocks than they've purchased for eight consecutive quarters (dating back to Oct. 1, 2022), totaling an aggregate of $166.2 billion. No stock accounts for a greater percentage of this $166.2 billion than top consumer brand Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30, Berkshire Hathaway has sold 615,560,382 shares of Apple, which reduced its stake in Wall Street's second-largest company by a staggering 67%. Keep in mind that even after dumping 615.56 million shares of Apple, it's still Berkshire's largest holding by almost $25 billion in market value.

During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, Buffett opined during the question-and-answer session with investors that the corporate income tax rate would likely head higher. He thus intimated that selling Apple's stock was a way for Berkshire to lock in sizable unrealized gains at a favorable tax rate.

However, with Donald Trump winning the presidency and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, corporate income tax increases look to be firmly off the table for at least the next four years. Considering that Apple's stock has risen significantly on its artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations as Buffett has sold, it's fair to say that Berkshire Hathaway has missed out on a pretty penny in gains.

These AI-fueled chips allow users to control computers with their brain activity and are primarily meant to help people with paralysis and severe neurological disorders.

While no product is actively being used in the market today, many companies are investing in the space, including big players like Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s Neuralink, and Precision Neuroscience.

Precision Neuroscience co-founder and CEO Michael Mager joined Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Yasmin Khorram at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference to explain how he expects the industry to expand in the coming years.

Mager says there are about 400,000 people in the US who are severely paralyzed and primary candidates for the technology. “That creates a $2.5 to $3 billion initial market in the next few years,” according to Mager.

In the future, the CEO expects a portion of the roughly five million people in the US with less severe motor disabilities to use BCIs as well.

Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven.

The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet.

The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines.

That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals.

Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals.

“Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief.

While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers.

“I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me.

Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group.

• USD (TSLA) View Quote Details

As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts.

As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender.

Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-apples-next-big-move-085000273.html,finance.yahoo.com,Prediction: This Will Be Apple's Next Big Move,,2024-10-25T08:50:00.000Z,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) brought about a revolution in the smartphone market in 2007 when it launched its first-ever iPhone, changing the fortunes of established smartphone companies such as Nokia and BlackBerry (known as Research in Motion at that time).

It's worth noting that Apple sold just 1.4 million iPhones in 2007. For comparison, the popular Nokia 3310 sold 7.4 million units in the fourth quarter of that year alone. The Nokia device was seven years old at that time, and it was simply a feature phone. However, Apple changed the game by infusing the internet, entertainment, and a touchscreen into the same device.

Apple has come a long way since then. It was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, according to IDC. The company shipped 234.6 million iPhones last year and controlled 20.1% of the market. It was slightly ahead of Samsung, which had a 19.4% share of the smartphone space last year. The two companies have long been involved in a fierce duel for smartphone supremacy and are now looking at artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock the next growth frontier in this space.

Samsung has been ahead of Apple in the generative AI smartphone market so far. However, Apple made its AI move in June this year when it introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI features. Let's take a closer look at Apple Intelligence and see why the company could use this feature to boost its growth.

The monetization of Apple Intelligence

Apple says its generative AI platform will unlock ""new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively."" From enabling users to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text to recording, transcribing, and summarizing audio to a more intelligent Siri, there are a bunch of tools that Apple Intelligence users will get access to.

Apple hasn't announced whether it will charge a fee for its generative AI features. However, there is a strong likelihood of the company heading in that direction. That's because Apple isn't just a hardware company. The tech giant has a flourishing services business that has generated $71 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, accounting for nearly a quarter of its top line.

The important thing here is that the services business has a much fatter margin profile than Apple's product business. Apple's services business reported a 74% gross margin in the fiscal third quarter, compared to the product segment's gross margin of 35%. The services business currently has a range of offerings that include cloud storage, music, TV, gaming, fitness, and news.

The accurately dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a mouthwatering aggregate return of more than 5,600,000% since he became CEO almost six decades ago.

Riding Buffett's coattails has been a surefire long-term investment strategy. Mirroring his trades is made simple thanks to required Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the SEC. This filing provides a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's best money managers are buying and selling -- and there's no 13F more anticipated each quarter than Berkshire Hathaway.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Over the last two years, Buffett and his team have been decisive net sellers of stocks. Based on the seven quarters of cash flow statements from Berkshire Hathaway (from Oct. 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024), Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have sold close to $132 billion more in stocks than they've purchased.

While no Warren Buffett stock has been given the heave-ho quite like Berkshire's No. 1 holding, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the Oracle of Omaha is finding value in Wall Street's most prominent reverse stock split stock of 2024.

Buffett has sent over 515 million shares of Apple to the chopping block since October 2023

Amid Warren Buffett's selling spree, top holding Apple has been meaningfully reduced. In a three-quarter period from Oct. 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024, Berkshire's stake in Apple declined by more than 515 million shares, or 56%, to precisely 400 million shares.

Benign profit-taking may very well be the catalyst that enticed Buffett to ring the register. During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, he opined that the corporate tax rate would likely climb in the future. With his company sitting on a mammoth unrealized gain in Apple, he suggested that locking in some gains now at a lower tax rate would, eventually, be viewed favorably by Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

To add to this point, Berkshire's chief has continued to praise Apple's business, even as he sizably pared down his company's No. 1 position. He appreciates Apple's strong branding and the loyalty of its customer base.

From $2.81, BofA raised its EPS projection for Nvidia's fiscal year 2025 to $2.87; from $3.90, it raised its projection for 2026 to $4.47. Also, its 2027 projection, that is expected to jump from $5.67 from $4.72, also represents a massive bump. Apart from the EPS changes, BofA underlined its Buy recommendation on Nvidia and raised its price target from $165 to $190.

Moreover, this week, the stock has reached new highs, reflecting investors' hope for the company's future. Under the direction of Vivek Arya, BofA analysts underscored Nvidia's robust free cash flow (FCF), with margins at 45% to 50%, roughly double the Mag-7 average of 23% to 25%. ""In dollar terms, NVDA could take in $200 billion of FCF over the next two years, rivaling Apple (AAPL) and providing growth optionality,"" Arya stated in a Thursday note to investors.

The stock's tumble began before the market opened in response to a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security.

The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell on the news. Intel declined to comment on the report. Nvidia and AMD did not immediately respond to requests from Yahoo Finance.

""While NVDIA has not disclosed its sales to the Gulf region, the level of investment in AI from that region has been very substantial,"" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance. ""More importantly, if the government continues to narrow the geographies chip companies can sell into, they are significantly narrowing the market for AI services for NVDIA customers Microsoft, Google and Amazon.""

Adding to the woes of chip stocks Tuesday was a dismal earnings report from semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML). The Dutch company — which sells equipment to Nvidia's chip manufacturer TSMC as well as Intel — reported booking orders worth just €2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) for the third quarter, far lower than the €5.39 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

The PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4.4% Tuesday, far underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which was down 0.5% midday.

Nvidia’s decline Tuesday partially reverses a two-week winning streak that saw the stock rally to a new record closing price Monday, nearly eclipsing Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street’s most valuable company. Shares closed above $138 Monday, ahead of its previous record of $135.58 in June. Nvidia's tear was fueled by industry leaders' comments about intense demand for its AI chips and renewed bullishness over AI.

Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector — which Nvidia leads — has pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year — when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips — before extending its historic rally.

Despite Tuesday’s decline, Nvidia shares are up 186% from last year. While demand for its AI chips is strong in the near term, a potential slowdown in AI spending by Big Tech companies is another cause for concern to investors, in addition to geopolitical risks. DA Davidson's Gil Luria recently told Yahoo Finance that AI spending could ease as soon as 2025, which would be bad news for Nvidia shares.

Story continues

Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.

(AAPL) Set to Launch iOS 18.1 and Apple Intelligence, Shifting from Annual Upgrade Cycle Amid Concerns Over iPhone Demand",,2024-10-12T11:01:01.000Z,"We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.

Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.

Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.

Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.

Story continues

As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Additionally, the facility aims to potentially employ upwards of 1,000 domestic and international experts, solidifying its place as Apple's most extensive R&D center outside the U.S.

Additionally, Apple's expansion comes at a point where there is heightened competition in the Chinese region, with domestic smartphone makers such as Huawei continuing to gain ground over the Cupertino giant. Moreover, a few months ago in March, Apple revealed it had built research centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, doubling its development team over the past five years.

Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down why he’s concerned about the iPhone maker in the near term despite expecting the company to be a major benefactor of artificial intelligence (AI).

“We're concerned about the upcoming cycle for a number of reasons,” Chkaiban says. “There are early data points suggesting that iPhone 16 reception is poor. Users are often disappointed. They see limited innovation. He adds that Apple Intelligence being delayed until after the initial launch of the device “doesn't really help.”

Among the other factors contributing to Apple’s near-term headwinds are shortening refresh cycles as “iPhone users hold onto their devices for longer” and increased competition in China. Another concern is a general weakness in consumer demand.

Chkaiban projects Apple will ship 215 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, which is 10% below consensus estimates.

Despite near-term concerns, the analyst says Apple is in a prime position in the AI era. He explains, “The generative AI iPhone revolution indeed won't be hardware-driven. It will happen over multiple cycles. It won't create a near-term product cycle, but it will still revolutionize the user experience over time and I do believe that Apple is very well positioned to capture some value as they control a large ecosystem of high-end devices.”

“Over coming years, I think Apple can do well with generative AI, with Apple intelligence getting rolled out. But it's not going to drive a near-term product cycle. That's what we're concerned about.”

He expects that Apple’s revenue will grow, but this growth will be driven by services rather than device sales. “Bottom line is Apple can probably grow revenues mid to high single digits and earnings between low-to-mid teens. And so yes, over the long run, I think Apple is definitely a good name to own. And if there is indeed a pullback related to weakness in the current cycle, that would probably create a good entry point.”

It's gone through some stunning ups and downs, but if you'd bought shares at the initial public offering (IPO) back in 1980 and held on, you'd have a lot more shares, and a lot of money. Let's see just how much.

Holding for the long term

Apple went public in December 1980 at $22 per share. Like pretty much any stock over a nearly 45-year period, Apple stock has climbed and crashed several times. For example, it lost 21% of its value between 1989 and 1996 -- a long period for an investor to hold on to a stock that's losing. But if you did, you'd have quite a windfall today.

Since that time, Apple has developed an incredible tech platform with a strong moat in its differentiated systems and applications. It has a strong, loyal fan base that only buys Apple products and consistently moves up to new drops and launches. Just this week Apple released its latest software update, iOS18, with a swarm of new upgrades and features. It's also investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive in the tech race.

That's why Apple stock has skyrocketed over time and gone through five stock splits: three 2-for-1 stock splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005; a 7-for-1 split in 2014; and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Each IPO share would have been worth $0.10 split adjusted, and you'd own 224 shares today. At today's prices, that's worth $48,455.

In short, the stock has appreciated more than 2,200 times since its IPO. For further perspective, if you had instead invested $1,000 in the stock at its IPO, your investment would've been worth $2.2 million today, excluding the dividends that were paid to you over the years.

Additionally, D.A.

On Tesla, Luria wrote “if it looks like a duck (greater than 90% of revenue from cars) and quacks like a duck (greater than 90% of profits from cars) it might just be a duck (a car company)"" in a note on Tuesday.

Luria sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to talk more about his call about these tech giants and their investments in AI and computing.

""Those markets require scale, reach, and capital. So unlike previous waves of technology innovation that came from startups, innovation now is coming from... these biggest companies. So these six companies will continue to dominate in AI and spatial computing, and extend their lead from the sectors they're already in — desktop and mobile computing, cloud computing and advertising, computing,"" Luria tells Yahoo Finance. ""They'll keep dominating those and they'll dominate the next two waves.""

Luria elaborates on how Meta is differentiating its AI usage and large language models from its Silicon Valley counterparts as prominent tech players continue to spend more on Nvidia chips.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed nearly 1.2%, coming off a hefty weekly loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped more than 450 points, or 1.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1%.

Financials (XLF), Industrials (XLI), and Energy (XLE) stocks led the market rebound. Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) led gains among the megacaps.

The major averages regained some of the ground they lost after the August jobs report failed to settle a key question: How aggressively will the Federal Reserve lower interest rates? The neither-hot-nor-cold data left Wall Street guessing whether a cut of 25 or 50 basis points is likely at this month's policy meeting.

She points out that some anticipated features include AI-powered text rewriting and email summarization, as well as an enhanced version of Siri tailored to individual users.

Regarding Apple's AI integration, Eadicicco told Yahoo Finance, ""I think Apple's approach, based on what we've seen, is more contextual, it's more about kind of connecting the dots between the different apps on your phone and kind of using Siri as a way to do that.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb sees room for Apple's (AAPL) stock price to climb, especially if the technology company successfully harnesses artificial intelligence for its iOS mobile operating system.

""Despite the stock’s recent strong appreciation, we see room for significant upside ahead as the magnitude of this new AI opportunity surprises,"" Loeb wrote to his investors in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Third Point built a position in Apple in April, Loeb wrote.

Loeb, whose firm oversees some $11 billion in assets, wrote that Apple was already one of the firm's top five winners during the second quarter when its TP Offshore Fund gained 1.8%. During the first half, the fund returned nearly 10%.

Apple, Loeb wrote, had been ""under-owned"" by institutional investors who feared the company might become an ""AI loser."" But Third Point has a different view, noting ""AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years.""

Demand for newer iPhones will grow as Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible and Apple's App Store will likely be the primary distribution platform for new consumer-focused AI apps, the letter said.

It was the summer of 1995. NASA’s space endurance record was broken, at a laughable 84 days compared to the two astronauts now who, DON’T CALL THEM STRANDED, may be in weightlessness for eight months. Johnnie Cochran was saying something poetic about gloves fitting, and the movie Waterworld was, um, drowning at the box office.

That was also a period when the Federal Reserve, then led by Alan Greenspan, embarked on an interest rate-cut cycle that may have parallels to what the markets are expecting for September.

Most Read from MarketWatch

The 1995 cycle coincided with disinflation and an economic soft landing that, importantly, did not morph into a recession. “There are enough similarities that the [1995 cycle] could provide a potential roadmap for corporate earnings and equity prices in the coming quarters,” said Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Investors would happily sign off to what happened. Earnings for the S&P 500 index companies rose by 12% in the year following the first rate cut. The S&P 500 soared more than 40% in the 18 months after, though mid- and small-caps didn’t rise by as much.

-

The sector mix was split, as this chart shows. Financials led the way, and Haverland says that performance could repeat itself now, as it recently upgraded the sector. Interestingly, the information technology sector outperformed leading into the first rate cut but then consolidated over the next six to 12 months, before reasserting itself as a leader. “If the sector takes a similar path during the upcoming easing cycle, we will look for opportunities to upgrade even given expectations for above-market growth,” he adds.

Granted, the current monetary policy cycle saw a much higher peak in inflation, and the Fed has held rates at peak levels for much longer. “Even so, we think the U.S. economy will avoid a recession and gradually strengthen through 2025. This, along with easier financial conditions, should support continued corporate earnings growth, equity-market strength, and our favorability toward high-quality companies within U.S. large-cap equities,” he said.

His latest moves in the stock market have captured the attention of investors. Under his control since 1965, he has led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK. A, BRK. B) to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 with his calculated decisions.

Don't Miss:

Buffett’s large stake in Apple (AAPL) has been a source of intrigue for years. Berkshire Hathaway began buying AAPL shares in 2016, and the technology giant became one of its largest holdings. Buffett previously had nice things to say about the technology giant, referring to it as a “better business” than other companies in Berkshire’s portfolio. Despite those positive comments, recent moves suggest Buffett is changing his strategy with Apple.

See Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

According to a report by CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway drastically reduced its stake from 905 million in Apple as of December 2023 to 400 million by June 2024, a 55% decline. Nobody might have expected this since Buffett has been a big admirer of the tech giant.

Perhaps this carries the sell-off reasoning toward Apple’s recent performance. The company still posted revenues of $85.8 billion in the June quarter – 4.8% above the same period last year – but the future outlook was grim.

See Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.

Sales on the Chinese market, a key market for Apple, plummeted by 6%, and the company’s operating income fared even worse with a 10% decrease. It lost its previous position in the top five smartphone companies within China, while competitive brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi fared very well. These problems and a valuation that some analysts believe appears stretched may have prompted Buffett to reassess his stance.

Despite trimming Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett remains bullish on another investment: Berkshire Hathaway. He has repurchased $5 billion of Berkshire shares in the last three quarters, indicating a bright outlook. “With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,” he wrote in a recent shareholder letter.

Story continues

Trending: Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

Berkshire Hathaway’s financial results have been outstanding despite its ups and downs. In June, the company reported a 1.2% revenue gain to $93.7 billion and a 16% rise in operating earnings to $11.6 billion.

The insurance group did particularly well, with earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investment up 56%. However, Berkshire’s GAAP net income dropped by 16%, to $30.3 billion, a number Buffett has called one that investors should pay very little attention to because of the volatility of unrealized gains and losses on stock investments.

Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

Analysts have long forecast Berkshire’s operating earnings to increase 10% in 2024 and then reduce by 3% growth in 2025. With Buffett’s ongoing buyback program, this would have given the appearance that he is getting extreme value for Berkshire Hathaway, even as he reduces his exposure to other assets, such as Apple.

Berkshire Hathaway could very well be a godsend for investors seeking a safe and stable long-term investment. If Warren Buffett continues to express so much faith in his own company, this might well be a green light for others to do the same.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-antitrust-loss-could-put-billions-at-risk-for-apple-215401052.html,finance.yahoo.com,Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple,,2024-08-05T21:54:01.000Z,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) suffered a staggering shot to its search and advertising business on Monday as District of Columbia's Judge Amit Mehta ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit against the tech giant.

It may cost Apple (AAPL) big-time too.

Here's how: The ruling could force Google to make dramatic changes to its largest business, but it could also force the company to cancel a long-term revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires the iPhone maker to use Google as the default search engine across its various devices.

The deal, called an Information Services Agreement, has been in place since 2002 and has been adjusted over the years as new technologies, such as the iPhone, have been introduced. The gist of the deal is that Apple uses Google as its default search engine for its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri.

In return, Google pays Apple 36% of the search revenue generated on Apple devices using Google’s services. While Apple doesn’t reveal exactly how much it makes from the deal, court documents pegged the number at an estimated $20 billion in 2022, double what Google paid in 2020.

Apple couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The revenue from Google and Apple’s agreement is likely realized under Apple’s Services business segment, which is where it lists third-party advertising licensing agreements. In 2022, Apple saw $78.1 billion in Services revenue. If the $20 billion estimate is accurate, that means the deal accounted for roughly 25% of Apple’s Services revenue for the year.

Apple’s Services business is one of its fastest-growing segments and is seen as a bulwark against the company’s slowing iPhone sales. The company has expanded the segment significantly over the years, adding its Apple Music+ and Apple TV+ platforms to the business. But the Google deal still likely makes up a massive chunk of the Services segment’s revenue.

From a company-wide perspective, Apple generated $394.3 billion in revenue in 2022, meaning the Google agreement accounted for 5% of the company’s annual revenue for the year.

Losing the ISA wouldn’t just hurt Apple, though. According to court documents, Google performed internal modeling in 2020 that found it would lose 60% to 80% of search volume on Apple’s iOS devices if its search engine were replaced as the default option.

Losing that search volume would cut into Google’s bottom line to the tune of $28 billion to $32 billion. With Google bringing in $182.5 billion in revenue in 2020, that would slice $15% to 17% off of the company’s bottom line.

Story continues

Google is sure to appeal the DOJ’s win, but if Mehta’s ruling stands, Apple and Google could be in for some serious financial pain.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) lost over 1,000 points before the bell. Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) were crushed by over 5% after the tech-heavy index entered into a correction with Friday's sharp losses. S&P 500 futures' (ES=F) losses cascaded around 4%.

Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" — the CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX) — soared, reaching its highest level since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Treasury yields plummeted, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) sinking below 3.8%.

The global stock market is in the midst of a rapidly intensifying sell-off after Friday's lackluster US jobs report added to concerns about the economy and on whether the Federal Reserve had waited too long to begin cutting interest rates. Of note, almost 100% of bets are on the central bank to cut rates by 0.5% by its September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Some of the biggest companies in the stock market were set to see their values plummet at the open. Apple (AAPL) was down more than 6% amid the sell-off, and also after news that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) had cut its stake in the company in half. Nvidia's (NVDA) pull back continued, as it dropped 10%. Tesla (TSLA) plunged more than 8%.

Crypto also took a beating, with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sinking more than 15% to creep back toward the $50,000 level.

The concerns have spread throughout the world, as well. Traders in Asia greeted the week with a similar sell-off, as Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) was routed by more than 12% in its biggest-ever daily loss. In commodities, meanwhile, oil was near its lows of the year, with WTI crude futures (CL=F) down to near $72 a barrel.

The US market is headed into a quieter week of data and earnings. With the jobs market still in focus, weekly unemployment claims due Thursday will take a bigger spotlight than usual.

Live 2 updates Markets correct through price or time Stocks were under heavy pressure early Monday and the story is both complicated and simple — investors fear the Fed waited too long to begin cutting rates. But the violent moves we're seeing in markets to what wasn't a great, but also not terrible, jobs report force us to turn our attention to the dynamics of the market itself rather than additional news about the economy, earnings, and so on. Which recalls to us one of our favorite market adages: markets correct through price or time. Meaning that when the price of any asset — a stock, bond, etc. — becomes divorced from its fundamental drivers, the price of that asset will find equilibrium by either falling in price or going nowhere while fundamentals catch up. With fears rippling through markets that the Fed is no longer cutting rates for the right reason (inflation is at its 2% target), but for the wrong reason (the economy is tipping into a downturn), investors are choosing the former option. The current earnings season is on track to show profits in the second quarter rose at the fastest annual pace in nearly three years. Recent market action suggests investors think expectations for future profits are simply too high. And rather than wait to see if stocks trading at current prices can ""grow into"" these valuations, investors are selling first and asking questions later.

What to watch today Good point by 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere in a new note on whether to buy the dip at the open: ""If investors are going to buy the oversold condition, credit spreads and inflation expectations need to send a signal that the current economic expansion will continue."" Suffice it to say, keep an eye on those two things throughout the session.",en,negative,0.9999971389770508

Shares of the chip giant crashed roughly 25% on Friday morning, following quarterly earnings on Thursday that could only be described as brutal. The company's ticker page on Yahoo Finance became the No. 1 most visited this morning, surpassing Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) after both tech titans reported better-than-expected quarters.

Intel missed analyst estimates widely on sales, gross profit margin, and earnings as it encountered more challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to ramp AI chip production.

The company took the drastic action of suspending its dividend, which will go into effect in the fourth quarter. Intel has paid a dividend for 125 straight quarters previously, including $3.1 billion in 2023.

The company further announced a 15% headcount reduction to preserve liquidity. It had about 125,000 employees as of the end of the second quarter.

The company also cut its capital expenditure spending for 2024 by 20% compared to its prior estimate. Capital expenditure for 2025 is seen to be about $5 billion lower than 2024 levels.

""This is the biggest restructuring of Intel I'd say since the memory microprocessor decision four decades ago,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told me in a live interview on Yahoo Finance. Gelsinger says he's in it for the long haul despite being disappointed in the quarter and outlook.

""This is what I signed up for [when I came in as CEO],"" Gelsinger added.

The quarter and commentary cast fresh doubt on Intel's efforts to regain a leadership position in an industry dominated by better-performing names Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD).

Earlier this year, Intel won $8.5 billion in grants and another $11 billion in loans from the Biden administration to build semiconductor plants in four states. The build-outs are part of Intel's goal to become a leading maker of chips for other companies, rivaling No. 1 player Taiwan Semiconductors (TSMC).

Now, Wall Street is voicing concern yet again on Intel's turnaround plan.

Said JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur, ""This marks the third consecutive quarter of negative revenue reset, and disappointing guidance, which we believe reflects the challenging industry fundamentals combined with company-specific drivers.""

Sur reiterated his Underweight (Sell equivalent) rating on Intel.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks could drop by between 10% and 13% this year, dragged down by a selloff in seven mega-cap stocks that previously pushed broader markets to record highs, a senior executive at Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) told Reuters.

""The market valuations on a standalone basis look extended, and therefore an annual drawdown or correction of 10% to 13% is very possible,"" Jitania Kandhari, deputy chief investment officer of MSIM's solutions and multi-asset group, said in an interview.

The seven mega-cap stocks, also referred to as the Magnificent Seven, are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA).

""We will begin to see the convergence between the rest of the market and mega 7, and that will continue,"" said Kandhari. MSIM manages $1.5 trillion in assets.

Still, large technology companies are generating cash and have stronger businesses than those which typically led other bouts of market weakness, she said.

The predicted declines will probably be more orderly than the dramatic losses in the early 2000s, when the dotcom bubble burst for tech companies that had bloated valuations.

""I don't expect a 1999-2000 kind of tech correction in the Nasdaq this time,"" she said.

MSIM is underweight technology stocks.

U.S. stocks are more expensive relative to their global peers, Kandhari added. The S&P 500 index is trading at a multiple of about 21 times forward earnings.

""If we have earnings growth that surfaces, then that number can go up,"" Kandhari said. ""But given current traction, 16.5 to 17 times is a good number on the S&P.""

The technology-fuelled Nasdaq Composite is trading at 28 times forward earnings, exceeding the MSCI All Country World Price Index, which trades at 18 times.

The S&P 500 index closed at 5,463.54 points on Monday, down 3.6% from a record close at 5,667.20 on July 16.

Industrial stocks are currently attractive, Kandhari said. Shares of companies producing consumer staples and discretionary goods are also appealing, given Americans' resilient spending.

""The interest rate sensitivity of the economy has come down,"" Kandhari said. ""Corporates have borrowed long term therefore higher rates have not affected them as much as people had anticipated.""

MSIM is also buying more financial stocks, which are benefiting from a steeper yield curve in U.S. Treasuries, Kandhari said. Short-term yields have declined faster than long-term yields in recent weeks.

Story continues

Still, the curve is currently inverted, with short-term yields higher than long-term debt. A return to an upward-sloping yield curve would reduce funding costs for banks and encourage more lending.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-stock-115100721.html,finance.yahoo.com,Why Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Stock Is a Must-Buy on the Dip,,2024-07-29T11:51:00.000Z,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM has become a new poster boy on the global artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy. The company is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world’s best AI chipset developers.

TSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.

Taiwan Semiconductor reported excellent results for second-quarter 2024 beating both top and bottom lines estimates, supported by a 3-nanometer chipset boom. TSM posted a strong revenue ramp-up across various segments. High-Performance Computing surged by 28%, Digital Consumer Electronics increased by 20%, Internet of Things (IoT) rose 6% and the Automotive sector rose 5%. Only Smartphone-related sales dropped a mere 1%.

Robust Clientele

TSM is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developers of generative AI-based chips. TSM also caters to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, Apple Inc. AAPL, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Intel Corp. INTC to name a few.

Taiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.

The company’s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies are contributing well to its top-line growth. In second-quarter 2024, 3nm, 5nm, 7nm, 16nm and 28nm accounted for 15%, 35%, 17%, 9% and 8% of the company’s wafer revenues, respectively.

Solid Outlook

For third-quarter 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor expects the solid adoption of AI and smartphones to boost the demand for its leading-edge process technologies. It projects revenues between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company also expects more than 20% growth in 2024 revenues due to rising demand for high-end chips used in AI applications.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and 2024 revenues is pegged at $22.72 billion and $85.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 31.5% and 23%, respectively.

The consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.69 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 31%. The estimate has been revised upward by 8.3% in the last 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.37 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.9%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.9% in the last seven days.

Reasonable Valuation

Taiwan Semiconductor belongs to the Zacks Defined Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry Industry, which currently stands at the top 1% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Since it is ranked in the top half of Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect the Circuit Foundry industry to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.

TSM is currently trading at a reasonable valuation compared to its peers. The company has a forward P/E of 25.16x, Price/Sales (P/S) of 10.85x and Price/Book (P/B) of 7.13x. All three parameters are in line with the current industry average.

TSM’s dominant position in the circuit foundry industry has enabled it to sustain margins. Despite facing inflationary forces, including rising electricity costs, TSM’s gross margin, operating margin, and net margin in the last reported quarter were 53.2%, 42.5%, and 36.8%, respectively.

Strong Upside Left

Taiwan Semiconductor recorded its all-time high price at $193.47 on Jul 11. After that, the stock price tumbled 16.3% due to an AI-related meltdown. However, the recent dip in stock price is a golden opportunity to enter this stock to enrich your portfolio over the long term.

The stock price has soared nearly 57% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 27.7% from the last closing price of $161.94. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$205. Finally, Taiwan Semiconductor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-a-fed-meeting-and-the-july-jobs-report-what-to-know-this-week-113019417.html,finance.yahoo.com,"Big Tech earnings, a Fed meeting, and the July jobs report: What to know this week",,2024-07-28T11:30:19.000Z,"The stock market rally is in its most fragile state in months ahead of Wall Street's busiest week of the summer.

The S&P 500 (GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) recently had their worst single-day drops since 2022 as the indexes struggled to recover losses during a Friday rally. All three major averages closed the final full week of July lower. The S&P 500 was down more than 1%, while the Nasdaq fell over 2.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose about 0.6%.

In the week ahead, a Federal Reserve meeting, the July jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) will drive the direction of markets to kick off August.

Updates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.

A busy week of corporate earnings awaits, with 171 members of the S&P 500 expected to report quarterly results. AMD (AMD), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) will be among the companies highlighting the schedule.

A September 'signal'

The Fed will announce its latest monetary policy decision next Wednesday. Markets largely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its July meeting.

Recent updates in the economy have investors eyeing when the Fed's first cut will come though. In June, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% over the prior year, its lowest annual increase in more than three years. Separate data for the month showed a significant decrease in another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Meanwhile, the labor market has shown signs of cooling. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is back at pre-pandemic levels, and last month, the unemployment rate hit its highest level since November 2021.

This has prompted markets to price in the Fed's first cut in September, and investors will be keenly listening to Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for any confirmation.

""The overall tone from the meeting, including from Chair Powell's press conference, should signal that a rate cut in September is a reasonable baseline without pre-committing to this action,"" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note to clients.

Labor market look

Friday will bring a fresh look at monthly job additions as economists continue to debate whether recent cooling in the labor market represents normalization or more significant deterioration.

Story continues

The July jobs report is expected to show 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.

""The 180K increase to payrolls we expect in July would still be a respectable gain, but would underscore that, directionally, the jobs market is deteriorating,"" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. ""By a range of measures, including the unemployment rate, quit rate, level of temporary help workers and small business hiring plans, the labor market is not only softer than a year or two ago, but weaker compared to its pre-pandemic state.""

Given this backdrop, whether unemployment holds steady or ticks up as it has for the past three months will be in particular focus.

Big Tech on deck

The stock market's recent slump has included a big sell-off in tech.

Since July 10, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — has dropped about 12%.

Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner recently told Yahoo Finance the pullback has made sense given the runup in Big Tech stocks over the past year and how overstretched positioning in many of the large tech stocks had become. This, combined with investors rotating into less-loved areas of the market rally that could benefit from the Fed cutting interest rates, has become the hallmark of the market action over the past two weeks.

Earnings from four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — could change that. But as the sell-off after Alphabet and Tesla earnings showed in the prior week, it's been a tough season to impress investors with earnings.

""When we look at the earnings that we've seen over the last week, I don't think the earnings are bad,"" Lerner said. ""I don't think the businesses, the fundamental business trends, are bad, but I just think that they were not good enough relative to these really high [expectations].""

And, to Lerner's point, stocks that miss on Wall Street estimates for earnings, revenue, or both are seeing significantly worse price reactions in the next trading day than typically seen over the past five years, according to research from Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.

For now, Emanuel wrote in a note to clients, ""earnings remain a catalyst for volatility, not higher S&P 500 prices.""

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tallied their worst one-day drops since 2022 on Wednesday and extended those losses on Thursday. Over the past 10 days the benchmark S&P 500 is down about 3%, while the Nasdaq is down more than 6%.

The recent pause in the rally's chug higher aligns with calls from equity strategists in our recently released third volume of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook. Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner noted that in years when the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the first half of the year, the second half usually sees an average pullback of about 9%.

Through the end of June, the S&P 500 was up about 14%.

""This choppier market action of late, which we have been anticipating, likely has further to go in terms of price and time,"" Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.

Tech has been the clear leader of the recent market drawdown. Information Technology and Communication Services are the only two of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 with negative returns over the past month. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Lerner reasoned that the recent sell-off in Tech made sense given how far up the sector had run.

In late June, tech had outperformed the S&P 500 on a rolling two-month basis by the most since 2002, per Lerner's research. Lerner reasons that, like a rubber band that becomes overstretched, there's usually a snapback from extreme levels of outperformance in markets.

""When we get that stretched, a little bit of bad news can go a long way,"" Lerner said.

The ""little bit of news"" came via earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA) after the bell on Tuesday leading into Wednesday's sell-off. Lerner noted that the earnings weren't bad but failed to impress investors, who had a high bar entering this reporting season.

Earnings from Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) expected next week will prove the next test for investor sentiment in the tech sector. Lerner reasoned that, after the market reset over the past few trading sessions, there's a chance technology's latest swath of earnings can surpass investors' now-trimmed expectations.

""I think the secular story of this bull market is still intact,"" Lerner said. ""Money will come back there. I just think more likely you need a resting period and kind of a pause that refreshes.""

BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski also highlighted the likelihood of a pause in stocks' climb higher in the latest edition of our Chartbook. Similarly to Lerner's analysis, Belski's work shows that going back to 1949, the second year of a bull market sees a roughly 9% average pullback. The most recent bull market started in October 2022.

Story continues

Belski told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday that the market was ""ripe for a pullback from a sentiment perspective."" But to Belski, this is a ""buying opportunity."" His research shows that markets typically bounce back an average of 14.5% from the bottom of the second-year bull market drawdowns he studied.

""Stocks will be higher at year-end,"" Belski said.

Or so says one veteran tech investor.

""I'm saying like it [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,"" EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above or listen here).

To put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.25 trillion or so currently.

Jackson reasoned the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report in August or November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.

That would align with what Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance on demand trends back in late May.

If Nvidia's earnings reports come in as he expects, Jackson thinks investors will be open to paying a much higher price-to-earnings (PE) multiple to own its stock.

That's a bold statement, seeing as Nvidia already trades on a forward PE of about 50 times, per Yahoo Finance data, almost two times the broader market multiple.

Added Jackson, ""I don't know if it's going to be August [earnings], I don't know if it's going to be November [earnings], but I think there is going be this euphoric reaction. And if so, the stock goes back to 65x forward earnings and you're there at like $250 per share.""

Nvidia shares trade at $131 as of this writing, up more than 170% year to date.

To be sure, it has been another year of milestones for Nvidia.

On June 18, its market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Before that, Huang took the wraps off his powerful Blackwell chips and proclaimed the company is building AI factories.

Nvidia has since lost the most-valuable-company crown to Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (second place), but detractors on the Street are few and far between.

""Positive takeaways for Nvidia include: 1) despite the impending launch of Blackwell in the second half of 2024, we are not seeing any signs of a demand pause as demand for H100 remains robust, as we continue to see rush orders; and 2) the interest and demand in GB200 is greater than we initially had sized as the majority of the mix is expected to be NVL72 vs. NVL36,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note this week.

A few non-Nvidia permabulls have started to appear, however.

New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded his rating on Nvidia last week to Neutral, citing valuation concerns.

Story continues

Ferragu said he sees ""limited further upside"" based on conversations with contacts in the supply chain. The bull case on Nvidia may not emerge beyond 2025, putting expectations at risk, Ferragu explained.

Meanwhile, Nvidia's success story is attracting hungry competitors — and that may stand in the way of the chip juggernaut, warned Goldman Sachs asset manager Brook Dane.

""There's very little likelihood that there isn't competition out there [for Nvidia],"" he said.

""We are in the early innings of a bull market where the earnings recovery story has barely begun,"" Bradesco BBI's head of equity strategy Ben Laidler told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).

Laidler, whose résumé includes stints at HSBC and JPMorgan, thinks there's a likelihood of two interest rate cuts this year from the Fed — which should fuel further investor excitement beyond expected strong earnings growth.

Those factors could help lift stocks at least 100% over five years, Laidler contended.

""Earnings might easily compound at 15% a year if the economy keeps chugging along and you get a little bit of multiple expansion, which I think lower interest rates would justify,” he said.

The current bull market for stocks is seen as starting in October 2022, when the S&P 500 (^GSPC) reached its most recent low. Since then, the index has gained a sizzling 55%. The index has gained nearly 17% so far this year, reaching its latest record on Friday.

The gains have been powered by enthusiasm around AI, which has driven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to record highs.

This year, the momentum has carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) beyond 40,000 and the S&P 500 beyond 5,000.

The S&P 500 is in the midst of the 16th strongest start to a year since 1950, according to data from Truist chief markets strategist Keith Lerner. The S&P 500 has now risen in seven of the past eight months.

Part of Laidler's thesis will be put to the test this coming earnings season, which begins with results from banks such as JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).

FactSet pegs second quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies at 8.8%. If achieved, it will mark the highest year-over-year growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. It will also represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index.

Double-digit-percentage earnings growth is expected in the Communications Services (18.5%) and Information Technology (16.1%) sectors.

After its board fired Steve Jobs in 1985, the company spent years in the wilderness. It suspended its dividend payout in 1996, and was close to bankruptcy when it brought Jobs back in 1997.

Shortly after that, Apple stock began a run that made it one of the most successful stocks in history, illustrating how innovation can dramatically improve a company's fortunes.

Apple's stock growth since Jobs' return

If one had bought $1,000 in Apple stock when Jobs returned in February 1997 and held on until today, that position would be worth around $1.8 million. That figure assumes this hypothetical investor would have reinvested their income from the dividend, which Apple reinstated in 2012.

Jobs' first major move after returning was to integrate the Mac ecosystem with the broader tech world, convincing Microsoft to invest $150 million in Apple and develop and support a Mac-compatible version of its popular Office software.

He also set to build an Apple ecosystem, revamping the Macintosh, launching the iMac in 1998, and following up with a new MacOS in 2001. The company gained additional traction by launching the iPod music player in 2001, and opening Apple Stores and the iTunes Store soon after.

However, the innovation that truly transformed Apple was the iPhone, which it launched in 2007. It pioneered the modern smartphone industry, and eventually eliminated many people's need to own a PC. So successful was the iPhone that it drives the majority of Apple's revenue to this day.

Apple's pace of innovation slowed with the passing of Jobs in 2011. Now, it more directly competes with devices and apps using Alphabet's Android operating system and with most of its mega-tech competitors in the artificial intelligence field.

Nonetheless, its continued innovations have at times made it the world's largest company by market cap, and positioned it in the top three today. Thanks to products such as the iPhone and its extensive ecosystem, Apple's stock price should continue to grow.
