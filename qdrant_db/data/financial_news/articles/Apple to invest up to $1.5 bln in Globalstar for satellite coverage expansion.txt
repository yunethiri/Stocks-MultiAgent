Shares of Globalstar jumped over 30%, while Apple was down around 1.4% a day after it forecast tepid <a href="/technology/apple-beats-wall-street-estimates-supported-by-iphone-sales-2024-10-31/">quarterly revenue growth</a>.
Under the funding agreement, Apple will commit $1.1 billion in cash and also purchase 20% equity in Globalstar for $400 million. The satellite company said it will use a portion of the funds to pay down debt.
The move is another in a line of partnerships between space firms and mobile service providers looking to provide <a href="/technology/comcast-starlink-sign-deal-provide-satellite-based-connectivity-businesses-2024-06-21/">satellite-based connectivity</a> to customers in regions with limited network access.
Globalstar also said it will allocate 85% of its network capacity to Apple. The deal is expected to close on Tuesday.
The iPhone maker <a href="/technology/apple-picks-globalstar-satellite-service-iphone-14-series-2022-09-07/">partnered with Globalstar in 2022</a> for a feature that would allow Apple users to send emergency messages from remote areas.
