Apple Watch Ultra 3 design

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reliable Apple leaker and respected analyst, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will not get any significant hardware upgrades. As such, it's likely Apple will rely on a host of new software upgrades to make the Apple Watch Ultra 3 more appealing.

The Apple Watch Ultra is relatively nascent (it launched in 2022), so the Cupertino-based tech giant likely isn't ready to give it a major design overhaul just yet. For now, Gurman says the main hardware upgrade that the third-generation Apple Watch is getting is a new chip.

This is a departure from what we're hearing about the Apple Watch Series 10 models, which are reportedly getting bigger screens, according to Gurman.

As such, expect the Apple Watch Ultra 3 to maintain the same specs, more or less, as its predecessor:

49mm case size

Titanium chassis

Always-on display with up to 3,000 nits of brightness

Interestingly, rumor has it that Apple planned on releasing an Apple Watch Ultra model with a microLED display that would set consumers back $1,500. However, this has reportedly been delayed to 2027.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 health features and sensors

Apple has reportedly been working on adding three new health features to the Apple Watch:

Blood-pressure monitor Sleep apnea sensor Glucose monitor

However, there has been scuttlebutt that Apple has been running into issues with the blood-pressure monitor in particular, especially for the Watch Series 10 design. And independent of the watches, the blood pressure sensor has been too unreliable during testing, according to Gurman.

It's unclear whether Apple will skip the blood pressure feature for the Apple Watch Series 10 and add it to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 â€” or ditch it altogether.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 battery life

If the rumor about Apple delaying the microLED display until 2027 is true, then the Apple Watch Ultra 3 may not get the battery life boost many were crossing their fingers for.

As it stands now, Apple claims that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers up to 36 hours of battery life. If the specs remain unchanged, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 may have the same runtime.

Apple Watch Ultra 3: Will it be worth the upgrade?

"If you spent $799 on an Apple Watch Ultra last year, it's unlikely you'll want to spring for this version," Gurman said.

In conclusion, based on the rumors and leaks, it looks like the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will just be an iterative update.

The rumor mill says there won't be any major hardware upgrades, but hey, you never know what the Cupertino-based tech giant may have up its sleeves when it announces the Apple Watch Ultra 3 on Sept. 9.
