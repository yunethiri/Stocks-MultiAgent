content: US stocks were mixed on Tuesday as investors trod carefully on the eve of a closely watched consumer inflation report seen as key to the path of interest rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the lone index in the red, hovering just below the flat line. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up about 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose almost 0.6% after all three gauges started the week with small losses.

While stocks are faltering, they are still holding not far off record highs as investors wait for Wednesday's update on consumer prices. Hopes are that the November inflation reading will provide further evidence of a "soft landing" for the economy, justifying widespread bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut in December.

In individual stock moves, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares jumped more than 4%, leading the Nasdaq higher, after the Google parent claimed breakthroughs in quantum computing through the use of its new Willow quantum chip.

Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) shares fell about 8% after its quarterly revenue fell short in the face of tough cloud competition.

Investors also weighed chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSM, 2330.TW) report of a 34% year-on-year jump in revenue in November. While the sales number suggested sustained AI demand, it was also a decline from the previous month's reading. The Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) suppliers' stock slipped about 1%.
