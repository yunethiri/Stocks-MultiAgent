In its quarterly report on Saturday, Berkshire said it sold about 100 million Apple shares, on top of several billion dollars of Bank of America <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BAC.N" target="_blank">(BAC.N)</a> shares.
Berkshire repurchased none of its own stock in the quarter, suggesting that Buffett doesn't view even his own company's shares as a bargain.
Operating profit from Berkshire's dozens of businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance fell 6% to $10.09 billion, or about $7,019 per Class A share, from $10.76 billion a year earlier.
Net income totaled $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share, compared with a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per share, a year earlier when falling stock prices reduced the value of Berkshire's investments.
