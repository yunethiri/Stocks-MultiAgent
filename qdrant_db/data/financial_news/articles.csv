The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O"" target=""_blank"">(NVDA.O)</a> and Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization.
The latest rally in Apple shares reflects ""investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a ""hold"" rating.
Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.GDAXI"" target=""_blank"">(.GDAXI)</a> and Switzerland's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SSMI"" target=""_blank"">(.SSMI)</a> main stock markets.
The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones.
In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology.
Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period.
Apple <a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/apple-adds-chatgpt-iphone-latest-ios-update-2024-12-11/"">earlier in December</a> started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after <a href=""/technology/apple-beats-wall-street-estimates-supported-by-iphone-sales-2024-10-31/"">unveiling plans in June </a>to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite.
The company <a href=""/technology/apple-beats-wall-street-estimates-supported-by-iphone-sales-2024-10-31/"">expects</a> overall revenue to increase ""low- to mid-single digits"" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series.
However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025.
""Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's ""top pick"" heading into 2025.
The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BRKa.N"" target=""_blank"">(BRKa.N)</a> has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations.
""I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today,"" said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares.
Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China.
""We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018,"" Woodring said.
Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year.
""Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
The Fed's action ""could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology.""
""Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments."

The lead counsel team stands to win an outsized share of legal fees stemming from any settlement of judgment against Apple.
The consumers' claims mirror a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department in March. The lawsuits allege Apple set up roadblocks to constrain consumer choice for mobile devices and for services such as digital wallets and messaging.

The U.S. firm <a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/apple-adds-chatgpt-iphone-latest-ios-update-2024-12-11/"">started</a> the rollout of OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices this month, part of the Apple Intelligence product that allows its Siri voice assistant to tap the chatbot's expertise including on user queries about photos and documents such as presentations.
ChatGPT is not available in China and the country's regulatory requirements mandate that generative AI services obtain government approval before public release, forcing Apple to seek local partners for its AI features at a time when its market share in the country is declining.
Apple's discussions with Tencent and ByteDance on using their AI models are at a very early stage, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are not public.
ByteDance declined to comment, while Apple and Tencent did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
A successful partner for Apple's AI services in China could be a major winner in the country's increasingly crowded AI field where dozens of large language models have been launched by large tech firms as well as startups.
They include ByteDance's Doubao, Tencent's Hunyuan and search engine giant Baidu's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/9888.HK"" target=""_blank"">(9888.HK)</a> Ernie.
Apple and Baidu have reportedly been in talks about using the latter's AI model in China, but The Information this month reported the discussions faced setbacks due to technical issues, including disputes over using iPhone user data to train AI models.
Baidu did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The absence of AI capabilities in the latest iPhones sold in China has become a major setback for Apple, as it faces declining market share in the world's biggest smartphone market due to growing competition from domestic brands including Huawei.
Huawei, which returned to the high-end market in August with a phone using a Chinese-made chip, launched its Mate 70 series <a href=""/technology/huawei-launches-mate-70-smartphone-2024-11-26/"">last month</a> featuring AI capabilities powered by its proprietary large language model.
Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter before recovering in the third quarter. The U.S. company's smartphone sales in China still <a href=""/technology/huaweis-q3-china-smartphone-sales-soar-apple-slips-2024-10-25/"">slipped 0.3%</a> during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42%, according to research firm IDC."

<a href=""/sustainability/society-equity/congo-files-criminal-complaints-against-apple-europe-over-conflict-minerals-2024-12-17/"">Criminal complaints</a> were filed against Apple subsidiaries in France and Belgium this week on behalf of Congo, accusing the tech firm of using conflict minerals in its supply chain.
Congo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten, so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. But some artisanal mines are run by armed groups involved in massacres, rapes and other crimes, say U.N. experts and rights groups.
Apple said on Tuesday that it strongly disputes the claims and has told suppliers they must not use the minerals in question sourced from Congo or Rwanda.
The lawyers representing Congo said on Wednesday they welcomed that statement with ""satisfaction and caution.""
""Apple's statements about changes to its supply chain will have to be verified on the ground, with facts and figures to support them,"" the lawyers said in a statement to Reuters.
""Apple's statements do not change the past and the crimes that are alleged to have been committed,"" they added, saying it was now up to the French and Belgian judges to rule on the case.
There has been no comment from either nation's prosecuting authorities.

SUPPLIERS INSTRUCTED
The lawyers argue that Apple used minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains, making it complicit in crimes taking place in Congo.
Apple does not directly source primary minerals and says it audits suppliers, publishes findings and funds bodies that seek to improve mineral traceability.
""As conflict in the region escalated earlier this year we notified our suppliers that their smelters and refiners must suspend sourcing tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold from the DRC and Rwanda,"" Apple said in its statement on Tuesday, using an abbreviation for Congo's full name.
It did not say when suppliers were notified.
""We took this action because we were concerned it was no longer possible for independent auditors or industry certification mechanisms to perform the due diligence required to meet our high standards.""
Apple said the majority of the minerals in question in its phones and computers are recycled.
Since the 1990s, Congo's mining heartlands in the east have been devastated by conflict between armed groups, some backed by neighbouring Rwanda, and the Congolese military.
Millions of civilians have died and been displaced.

At stake in a trial in U.S. federal court in Delaware this week is the fate of Qualcomm's push into the laptop business, where it is helping partners such as Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> try to regain ground that Windows computers lost to Apple after the iPhone maker introduced its own custom chips.
Arm's flagship product is a computing architecture that competes against Intel's architecture and is ubiquitous in smartphones and increasingly used in laptops and data centers. Competing computing architectures are the reason that, until relatively recently, most smartphone apps did not work on most laptops.
Massive companies like Apple design their own computing cores based on Arm's architecture, but Arm also offers its own off-the-shelf core designs that are used by smaller firms such as MediaTek <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/2454.TW"" target=""_blank"">(2454.TW)</a>. Where Arm's ownership of the core designs based on its architecture begins and ends is at the heart of the dispute between Arm and Qualcomm.
The companies disagree over whether Nuvia, a firm Qualcomm paid <a href=""/business/qualcomm-eyes-challenge-apple-intel-with-14-billion-deal-chip-startup-2021-01-13/"">$1.4 billion for in 2021</a>, had the right to transfer its computing core designs to Qualcomm after the sale.
In U.S. federal court in Delaware on Tuesday, attorneys for both sides pressed Gerard Williams, a former Apple engineer who founded Nuvia in 2019, over whether Nuvia's cores were ultimately derivatives of Arm's technology or whether Arm's technology played only a trivial role in Nuvia's work.
Arm's attorney pressed Williams to acknowledge that the licensing contract at the heart of the dispute covered Arm technology and ""derivatives"" and ""modifications"" made from it.
Williams repeatedly said he did not believe the contract meant that all of Nuvia's work was a derivative or modification of Arm's technology, but acknowledged that was what the words on the page appeared to say.
Daralyn Durie, the Arm attorney, pointedly asked Williams to agree that ""maybe you wouldn’t say that, but that’s what the contract says.""
“I wouldn’t say that,"" Williams responded, ""but I’m not a legal expert.”
Durie immediately said she was finished with her questioning.
The exchange with Durie followed questioning by Qualcomm's attorney, who guided Williams to describe how little Arm technology was in Qualcomm chips that power phones, laptops and cars.
Williams said his team of developers started with Arm architecture and was asked to estimate the amount of Arm's technology in Nuvia's final designs. ""One percent or less,"" Williams responded.
Analysts have told Reuters that Qualcomm pays Arm about $300 million per year, and evidence introduced at trial on Monday showed Arm executives believed they were missing out on $50 million per year in additional revenue because of Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia.
A jury verdict could come as soon as this week in the trial, and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon also might take the witness stand."

Congo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten, so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. But some artisanal mines are run by <a href=""/world/africa/why-fighting-is-flaring-eastern-congo-threatening-regional-stability-2024-02-19/"">armed groups</a> involved in massacres of civilians, mass rapes, looting and other crimes, according to U.N. experts and human rights groups.
Apple does not directly source primary minerals and says it audits suppliers, publishes findings and funds bodies that seek to improve mineral traceability.
Its 2023 <a href=""https://s203.q4cdn.com/367071867/files/doc_downloads/2024/04/Apple-Conflict-Minerals-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">filing on conflict minerals</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said none of the smelters or refiners of 3T minerals or gold in its supply chain had financed or benefited armed groups in Congo or neighbouring countries.
But international lawyers representing Congo argue that Apple uses minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains, which they say renders the firm complicit in crimes taking place in Congo.
In parallel complaints filed to the Paris prosecutor's office and to a Belgian investigating magistrate's office on Monday, Congo accuses local subsidiaries Apple France, Apple Retail France and Apple Retail Belgium of a range of offences.
These include covering up war crimes and the laundering of tainted minerals, handling stolen goods, and carrying out deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers supply chains are clean.
""It is clear that the Apple group, Apple France and Apple Retail France know very well that their minerals supply chain relies on systemic wrongdoing,"" says the French complaint, after citing U.N. and rights reports on conflict in east Congo.
Belgium had a particular moral duty to act because looting of Congo's resources began during the 19th century colonial rule of its King Leopold II, Congo's Belgian lawyer Christophe Marchand said.
""It is incumbent on Belgium to help Congo in its effort to use judicial means to end the pillaging,"" he said.
The complaints, prepared by the lawyers on behalf of Congo's justice minister, make allegations not just against the local subsidiaries but against the Apple group as a whole.
France and Belgium were chosen because of their perceived strong emphasis on corporate accountability. Judicial authorities in both nations will decide whether to investigate the complaints further and bring criminal charges.
In an unrelated case in March this year, a U.S. federal court <a href=""/legal/us-appeals-court-dismisses-child-labor-case-against-tech-companies-2024-03-05/"">rejected an attempt</a> by private plaintiffs to hold Apple, Google, Tesla, Dell and Microsoft accountable for what the plaintiffs described as their dependence on child labour in Congolese cobalt mines.

MINERALS FUEL VIOLENCE
Since the 1990s, Congo's mining heartlands in the east have been devastated by waves of fighting between armed groups, some backed by neighbouring Rwanda, and the Congolese military.
Millions of civilians have died and been displaced.
Competition for minerals is one of the main drivers of conflict as armed groups sustain themselves and buy weapons with the proceeds of exports, often smuggled via Rwanda, according to <a href=""https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n24/118/80/pdf/n2411880.pdf"" target=""_blank"">U.N. experts</a> and <a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/africa/east-africa-the-horn-and-great-lakes/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/report-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/"" target=""_blank"">human rights organisations</a>.
Rwanda denies benefiting from the trade.
Among the appendices to Congo's legal complaint in France was a <a href=""ttps://www.state.gov/statement-of-concern-related-to-certain-minerals-supply-chains-from-rwanda-and-eastern-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-contributing-to-the-ongoing-conflict/"" target=""_blank"">statement issued by the U.S. State Department</a> in July, expressing concerns about the role of the illicit trade in minerals from Congo, including tantalum, in financing conflict.
The statement was a response to requests from the private sector for the U.S. government to clarify potential risks associated with manufacturing products using minerals extracted, transported or exported from eastern Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
Congo's complaints focus on ITSCI, a metals industry-funded monitoring and certification scheme designed to help companies perform due diligence on suppliers of 3T minerals exported from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
Congo's lawyers argue that ITSCI has been discredited, including by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) of which Apple is a member, and that Apple nevertheless uses ITSCI as a fig leaf to falsely present its supply chain as clean.
The RMI, whose members include more than 500 companies, announced in 2022 it was <a href=""/markets/commodities/responsible-minerals-initiative-cuts-traceability-scheme-itsci-approved-list-2022-10-31/"">removing ITSCI</a> from its list of approved traceability schemes.
In July this year, it said it was <a href=""https://www.responsiblemineralsinitiative.org/news/rmi-update-on-itsci-recognition-and-great-lakes-region-due-diligence/"" target=""_blank"">prolonging the suspension</a> until at least 2026, saying ITSCI had not provided field observations from high-risk sites or explained how it was responding to an escalation of violence in North Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and is a key 3T mining area.
ITSCI criticised the RMI's own processes and <a href=""https://www.itsci.org/2024/07/12/response-to-the-5th-july-2024-rmi-memo-on-itsci-recognition/"" target=""_blank"">defended its work</a> in Congo as reliable. It has also rejected allegations in a 2022 report by campaigning group Global Witness entitled <a href=""https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/natural-resource-governance/itsci-laundromat/"" target=""_blank"">""The ITSCI Laundromat""</a>, cited in Congo's legal complaint in France, that it was complicit in the false labelling of minerals from conflict zones as coming from mines located in peaceful areas.
Apple mentioned ITSCI five times in its 2023 filing on conflict minerals. The filing also made multiple mentions of the RMI, in which Apple said it had continued active participation and leadership, but did not mention the RMI's ditching of ITSCI.
In its July statement, the U.S. State Department said flaws in traceability schemes have not garnered sufficient engagement and attention to lead to changes needed.
Robert Amsterdam, a U.S.-based lawyer for Congo, said the French and Belgian complaints were the first criminal complaints by the Congolese state against a major tech company, describing them as a ""first salvo"" only."

November is by far the most important month for company returns when around a quarter of the year's corporate tax is paid. Ireland took in 13.7 billion euros in corporate tax in the month of November, an increase of 117% on last year.
""The bulk of the increase is due to receipts arising from the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling of September 10,"" the ministry said, without specifying exactly how much.
Ireland is due to draw down the Apple back taxes from an escrow account over several months following a ruling in September that its favourable tax treatment of the iPhone maker had been unlawful.
The overall tax take in the year to the end of November was 20.8% higher than the same period last year, driven also by growth in income tax and VAT, the other two largest tax types. Most self-employed income tax returns are paid in November.
Ireland expects to bank 8 billion euros of the Apple back taxes this year, pushing its overall tax take 20% higher year-on-year, and this year's budget surplus to 7.5% of national income."

U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson in San Francisco <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gdpzkbygxvw/Epic%20v%20Apple%20discovery%20order%2020241202.pdf"" target=""_blank"">rejected</a> Apple’s effort to withhold the documents from Epic. The game maker had accused Apple of failing to comply with a 2021 ruling in the case that required it to give developers more power to steer app users to non-Apple payment options.
Epic has asked a judge to <a href=""/legal/transactional/apple-judges-document-demands-could-delay-epic-antitrust-ruling-2024-06-05/"">hold Apple in contempt</a> of that court order, which came in its lawsuit accusing Apple of antitrust violations. Apple was ordered in May to produce all of its internal documents concerning its work to comply with the judge’s order.
Apple and Epic did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple has <a href=""/legal/apple-denies-violating-us-court-order-epic-games-lawsuit-2024-04-13/"">denied violating</a> the court’s injunction.
Apple has produced 95,000 documents to Epic, but has held back 57,000 others, court <a href=""https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1039.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">records show</a>.
Apple last month told the court that “a substantial number of those documents” are protected by attorney-client privilege, which shields confidential legal communications between lawyers and their clients.
Epic argued that the shield rule did not apply to the files. It accused Apple of withholding “tens of thousands of responsive, relevant documents on the basis of facially improper and unsubstantiated privilege claims.”
Hixson criticized Apple in his order on Monday for stretching its privilege arguments too far.
“Privilege does not descend like a giant fog bank over every document that is in some way connected with an effort to achieve legal compliance,” Hixson wrote.
Hixson said it was “improper” for Apple to claim attorney-client privilege to shield some business decisions that concerned user interface design. He also said Apple must turn over a draft press briefing.
Other technology companies have also faced criticism over broad assertions of attorney-client privilege.
The U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 had <a href=""/legal/litigation/us-judge-google-case-not-convinced-companys-conduct-will-get-sanction-2022-04-08/"">accused</a> Google in an antitrust lawsuit in Washington, D.C. of ""extensive and intentional"" efforts to misuse attorney-client privilege to hide business documents. The DOJ said Google employees were trained to add lawyers to emails, and to ask them questions.
Google denied that its practices violated any professional conduct rules, and a judge declined to sanction the company.
The case is Epic Games v. Apple, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 4:20-cv-05640-YGR.

The complaint filed in California state court on Sunday by Amar Bhakta, who works in digital advertising for Apple, claims the company requires employees to install software on personal devices that they use for work allowing Apple to access their email, photo libraries, health and ""smart home"" data and other personal information.
At the same time, the lawsuit alleges, Apple imposes confidentiality policies that prohibit employees from <a href=""/legal/government/apple-accused-by-nlrb-deterring-employees-discussing-pay-equity-2024-11-01/"">discussing working conditions</a>, including with the media, and engaging in legally-protected whistleblowing.
Bhakta, who has worked for Apple since 2020, says he was barred from talking about his work on podcasts and instructed to remove information about his working conditions from his LinkedIn profile.
""Apple's surveillance policies and practices chill, and thus also unlawfully restrain, employee whistleblowing, competition, freedom of employee movement in the job market, and freedom of speech,"" the lawsuit said.
Apple in a statement provided by a spokesperson said the claims in the lawsuit lack merit and that its workers are trained annually on their rights to discuss their working conditions.
“At Apple, we're focused on creating the best products and services in the world and we work to protect the inventions our teams create for customers,"" the company said.
Lawyers for Bhakta also represent two women who <a href=""/technology/apple-accused-lawsuit-underpaying-female-workers-california-2024-06-13/"">filed a lawsuit in June</a> accusing Apple of systematically underpaying female workers in its engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions. Apple has said it is committed to inclusion and pay equity.
Apple is also facing at least three complaints from a U.S. labor board claiming it has <a href=""/legal/government/apple-accused-by-nlrb-deterring-employees-discussing-pay-equity-2024-11-01/"">illegally deterred employees</a> from discussing issues such as sex bias and pay discrimination with each other and the media, including by restricting their use of social media and workplace messaging app Slack. The company has denied wrongdoing.
The new lawsuit was filed under a unique California law that allows workers to sue their employers on behalf of the state and keep 35% of any penalties that are recovered."

MercadoLibre's complaint, filed in 2022 in Brazil and Mexico, accused Apple of imposing a series of restrictions on the distribution of digital goods and in-app purchases, including banning apps from distributing third-party digital goods and services such as movies, music, video games, books and written content.
In the complaint, MercadoLibre criticized the California tech giant for requiring developers that offer digital goods or services within apps to use Apple's own payment system and stopping them from redirecting buyers to their websites.
Cade ruled that Apple must allow app developers to add tools so customers can buy their services or products outside the app, such as through the use of hyperlinks to external websites.
Another preventive measure is that Apple must allow app developers to offer other in-app payment processing options apart from the one owned by Apple, the regulator added.

Indonesia in November banned sales of Apple's iPhone 16 after it failed to meet requirements that smartphones sold domestically should comprise at least 40% locally-made parts.
Indonesia has also banned the sale of Alphabet's <a href=""/technology/indonesia-bans-sales-google-smartphones-days-after-blocking-apples-iphone-16-2024-11-01/"">Google Pixel phones</a> over a similar lack of use of local components.
Indonesian authorities last week said Apple had put forward the investment <a href=""/technology/apple-sends-100-mln-investment-proposal-build-plant-indonesia-2024-11-20/"">proposal</a> to lift the sales ban.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We have done an assessment and this (proposal) has not met principles of fairness,"" Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita told a press conference, comparing the proposal to Apple's bigger investments in neighboring <a href=""/technology/apple-wants-spend-more-suppliers-vietnam-2024-04-16/"">Vietnam</a> and <a href=""/technology/apple-talks-with-suppliers-make-macbooks-thailand-nikkei-2023-04-13/"">Thailand</a>.
Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but has since 2018 set up application-developer academies, which Jakarta considers a way for the company to meet local content requirement for the sale of older iPhone models.
Companies usually increase the use of domestic components to meet such rules through partnerships with local suppliers or by sourcing parts domestically.
Agus said Apple had an outstanding investment commitment of $10 million it should have carried out before 2023. He also wanted Apple to commit to new investment until 2026.
The ministry would invite Apple to visit Indonesia to negotiate further, Agus said."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in August ordered a <a href=""/technology/india-orders-unusual-recall-reports-apple-antitrust-probe-2024-08-13/"">recall</a> of investigation reports after Apple said the watchdog had disclosed commercial secrets to competitors in the case dating back to 2021, including Tinder-owner Match <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MTCH.O"" target=""_blank"">(MTCH.O)</a>. These elements should have been redacted.
The CCI had asked parties to return the reports and destroy any copies. The regulator then issued new reports.
The CCI internal order showed that Apple in November alleged that the main complainant in the antitrust investigation - Indian non-profit Together We Fight Society (TWFS) - had not complied with the directives to give an assurance that the old investigation reports had been destroyed.
Apple asked the CCI ""to take action against TWFS for non-compliance with its order"" and ""to withhold the revised"" report, the CCI order, dated Nov. 13, seen by Reuters showed.
""Apple's request to hold the investigation report in abeyance was deemed untenable,"" the CCI said in the order.
Apple did not respond to Reuters queries.
The CCI did not respond outside regular business hours on Sunday. Calls to representatives of TWFS went unanswered.
A CCI investigation had found that Apple exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system to the detriment of app developers, users and other payment processors.
Apple has denied wrongdoing and said it is a small player in India where phones that use Google's Android system are dominant.
The CCI internal order also showed that Apple has been asked to submit its audited financial statements for fiscal years 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24 under regulatory guidelines aimed at determining possible monetary penalties in the case.
The CCI's senior officials will review the investigation report and make a final ruling on the case."

U.S. District Judge Julien Neals in Newark, New Jersey, is scheduled to hear arguments from lawyers for Apple, and from prosecutors who say the company locks users in and keeps competition out by limiting interoperability between the iPhone and third-party apps and devices.
Apple has <a href=""/legal/apple-says-us-antitrust-lawsuit-should-be-dismissed-2024-05-21/"">moved to dismiss the case</a>, saying its limitations on developers' access to its technology were reasonable, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.
Antitrust cases against Big Tech firms are a bipartisan trend. The case against Apple began during the first presidential term of <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/"">Donald Trump</a> and was filed during the administration of President <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/joe-biden/"">Joe Biden</a>.
In other cases, Alphabet's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O"" target=""_blank"">(GOOGL.O)</a> Google was found to have an <a href=""/legal/us-judge-rules-google-broke-antitrust-law-search-case-2024-08-05/"">illegal monopoly in online search</a>, Meta Platforms <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O"" target=""_blank"">(META.O)</a> faces trial on claims that it <a href=""/legal/meta-will-face-antitrust-trial-over-instagram-whatsapp-acquisitions-2024-11-13/"">squelched competition by acquiring upstart rivals</a>, and Amazon.com <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O"" target=""_blank"">(AMZN.O)</a> is fighting a case over its policies toward sellers and suppliers.
But some claims like the ones at the heart of the Apple case have ultimately failed.
A judge dismissed the Federal Trade Commission's claim against Meta over the social media platform's restrictions on third-party app developers.
In the Google search case, the judge <a href=""/legal/google-monopoly-ruling-could-help-apple-defense-antitrust-case-2024-08-06/"">rejected a claim</a> that Google should have done more to accommodate advertisers on Microsoft's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> search engine, Bing.
Apple cited the ruling in its own case, saying it shows that withholding access to technology should not be considered anticompetitive.
The Apple lawsuit filed in March by the DOJ and a coalition of states takes aim at restrictions and fees on app developers, and technical roadblocks to third-party devices and services - such as smart watches, digital wallets and messaging services - that would compete with its own.
If the judge finds the claims plausible, the case will be allowed to move forward."

Ireland's tax collection increased by 14.9% in the first 10 months of the year, compared with the same period in 2023, as the first portion of a 14 billion euro ($14.74 billion) back-tax windfall boosted already healthy revenues.
An <a href=""/world/europe/ireland-unveil-bumper-pre-election-budget-apple-windfall-plans-2024-09-30/"">explosion in corporate tax revenues</a>, mainly paid by a few large U.S. multinationals, has handed Ireland one of Europe's few budget surpluses, and a one-off collection of back taxes from Apple Inc is set to push that surplus to 7.5% of national income this year.
S&P estimates the Irish government will run a fiscal surplus equivalent to 7.4% of national income.
""Yet, even without the Apple tax windfall, other regular corporate tax receipts had been continuing to surge, and we estimate the surplus excluding the Apple windfall will still be about 2.8% of national income, which continues to be the highest in the eurozone,"" S&P said.
S&P affirmed the ""AA/A-1+"" long- and short-term ratings of Ireland while suggesting it could be raised in the next 24 months if the country continues to rebuild economic and fiscal buffers, improving its resilience to external shocks.

Apple and Roskomnadzor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters reporters in Russia could still access the app on mobile devices.
Under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has put dozens of opposition media websites on blacklists and banned several foreign social-media platforms in a crackdown it casts as part of an information war unleashed by the West after Moscow's 2022 <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/"">invasion of Ukraine</a>.
Moscow's restriction of news sites ultimately limits Russians' access to independent media. Moscow often accuses blocked sites of false reporting.
RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who had been found guilty in Russia of <a href=""/world/europe/russian-court-sentences-rferl-journalist-kurmasheva-65-years-prison-court-press-2024-07-22/"">spreading false information</a> about the Russian army, was released in a prisoner swap with the West on Aug. 1. RFE/RL CEO Stephen Capus had called Kurmasheva's trial and conviction ""a mockery of justice"".
One of RFE/RL's local websites in Russia, Siberia.Realities, said Apple had notified Radio Svoboda, which means ""freedom"" in Russian, that the Svoboda app was being deleted. The app houses Russian content from the Siberia.Realities and North.Realities projects.

Which? said Apple encouraged its users to sign up to iCloud to store photos, videos and other data while making it difficult to use alternative providers.
Customers then had to pay for the service once their data exceeded the free 5GB limit, it said.
Which? said the resulting lack of competition had led to consumers being overcharged, by up to 13.36 pounds ($16.98) this year, through their monthly iCloud subscription.
Apple said in a statement its customers were not required to use iCloud and many used third-party alternatives.
""We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anticompetitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise,"" it said.
About 40 million Apple customers in Britain who have obtained iCloud services over the last nine years could be entitled to a payout if the claim is successful, Which? said.
Its Chief Executive Anabel Hoult said the group believed Apple customers were owed nearly 3 billion pounds as a result of the tech giant forcing its iCloud services on customers.
""Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market,"" she said.
Which? said it would file the claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal.

<a href=""https://tmsnrt.rs/4frDw5d"" target=""_blank"">The complaint</a> issued by the NLRB General Counsel on Thursday is the third in a month to claim that Apple has <a href=""/technology/apple-accused-by-us-labor-board-imposing-illegal-workplace-rules-2024-10-01/"">illegally deterred employees</a> from discussing issues such as sex bias and pay discrimination with each other and the media, including by restricting their use of social media and <a href=""/technology/apple-accused-restricting-workers-slack-social-media-use-by-us-labor-board-2024-10-11/"">workplace messaging app Slack</a>.
The new complaint alleges that Apple barred workers from creating a Slack channel to discuss pay equity and from discussing a policy outlining financial incentives for reaching sales goals.
And in 2021, the company forced the engineer, <a href=""/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"">Cher Scarlett</a>, to quit after she posted an online survey where coworkers could anonymously share information about their wages, job levels, years of experience and personal demographics, according to the complaint.
Apple in a statement provided by a spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with these claims and will continue to share the facts at the hearing.”
The tech giant has said in response to other recent complaints that it is committed to maintaining ""a positive and inclusive workplace"" and takes employees' concerns seriously.
Laurie Burgess, Scarlett's lawyer, in an email said ""we are delighted to see the NLRB issue a complaint against Apple and look forward to holding it accountable at trial for its extensive violations of workers' labor rights.""
Absent a settlement, an administrative law judge will hold an initial hearing in the case in June. The judge's ruling can be reviewed by the five-member board, whose decisions can be appealed to federal appeals courts.
The complaint seeks to force Apple to reinstate Scarlett and make her whole for backpay and other financial harms stemming from constructive discharge. The general counsel is also seeking to require the company to conduct trainings on workers' labor rights.
Apple is facing at least two other pending NLRB cases claiming it fired an employee at its Cupertino, California, headquarters for criticizing managers and illegally interfered with a union campaign at a retail store in Atlanta. The company has denied wrongdoing.
The case is Apple Inc, National Labor Relations Board, No. 32-CA-282396.

Apple said sales were $94.93 billion, ahead of Wall Street targets of $94.58 billion, according to LSEG. Earnings of $1.64 per share, excluding a massive one-time <a href=""/technology/apple-loses-fight-against-13-billion-euro-eu-tax-order-ireland-2024-09-10/"">tax charge</a> in the European Union, topped analyst expectations of $1.60 per share.
Sales of its iPhone, the company's main product, were up 5.5% to $46.22 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $45.47 billion. Other product lines missed expectations, and shares were down about 1% in extended trading.
Apple's fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, meaning it reflects only a few days of sales of its iPhone 16 series that went on sale Sept. 20. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters that iPhone 16 sales grew faster than iPhone 15 sales did a year earlier, with both phones on sale for the same number of days in the fourth quarter.
He also said Apple customers are downloading a new version of its iPhone operating system with what it calls Apple Intelligence features at twice the rate they had the year before.
""We've had great feedback from customers and developers already,"" Cook said. ""We're off to a good start.""
Investors will be listening closely to a 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) conference call where Apple executives will outline expectations for the fiscal first quarter, which encompasses holiday sales in the U.S., Europe and several other markets.
The rollout of Apple's artificial-intelligence strategy, which it <a href=""/technology/ai-is-sole-focus-apples-annual-conference-2024-06-10/"">revealed this year</a>, hinges on how well its new phones sell.
Rather than introduce AI in a standalone app or service, Apple has sprinkled Apple Intelligence throughout its most recent operating systems as new features, such as the ability to help re-write an email in a more professional tone. Those features will mostly be available on iPhone 16 models, which feature more powerful computing chips, although the pro versions of the iPhone 15 both work with Apple Intelligence.
While some of those Apple Intelligence features arrived this week, others have been delayed, which has led some Wall Street analysts to wonder whether consumers will be <a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/apples-ai-gap-new-iphones-disappoints-china-users-huawei-threat-looms-2024-09-10/"">slower to upgrade</a> their devices this year while flagship software features trickle out.
The early iPhone 16 results on Thursday could allay some of those concerns. IPhone sales helped steady Apple's fourth-quarter sales in China, which were down less than 1% to $15.03 billion overall. Analysts were expecting China sales of $15.78 billion on average, according to data from Visible Alpha.

SPENDING RISES
Apple's rivals Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> and Meta <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O"" target=""_blank"">(META.O)</a> both said this week they expect <a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-microsoft-lift-ai-spending-worrying-wall-street-ahead-amazon-results-2024-10-31/"">continued increases in spending</a> to support their AI strategies. Apple said payments for property and equipment - a measure of its capital expenditures - were up $2.91 billion from the previous quarter to $9.45 billion.
Apple's lower spending comes in part because it uses third-party data centers for some AI work. Some aspects of Apple Intelligence do rely on Apple's own data centers, but the company is using its own in-house chips to power those features.
""There would be some (financial) benefit to us by using our own silicon, obviously, but that's not the reason we're doing it. We're doing it because we can provide the same standard of privacy and security that we can provide on device,"" Cook said.
Sales in Apple's services business, which includes iCloud storage and Apple Music, were $24.97 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $25.28 billion, according to LSEG. Mac and iPad sales were $7.74 billion and $6.95 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $7.82 billion and $7.09 billion, according to LSEG data.
Sales in Apple's home and wearables business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods devices, fell to $9.04 billion, compared with estimates of $9.2 billion, according to LSEG.
Earnings per share were 97 cents including the charge related to a one-time multi-billion-euro European tax payment."

The results will provide investors the first hints of demand for the latest iPhone 16 series, which was released a few days before the end of the company's fiscal fourth quarter.
But the focus will be on executive commentary for its fiscal first quarter amid fears that releasing its Apple Intelligence features at a slow pace could dampen a much-awaited AI-led ""super-cycle"" for Apple's biggest seller.
The company is playing catch-up in AI as Android smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/005930.KS"" target=""_blank"">(005930.KS)</a> and software rivals such as Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> aggressively roll out applications aimed at tapping the generative AI boom.
""The strength of the iPhone 16 cycle is the most important question heading into both the December quarter and FY25,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.
""Investors should expect Apple to be upbeat about iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence, but it may or may not necessarily reflect the ultimate success of the cycle.""
The company on Monday started a limited rollout of the features to U.S. customers in English, weeks after the iPhone 16 went on sale.
For now, Apple Intelligence will remain unavailable in key markets including Europe and China, where the tech giant is under pressure from a resurgent Huawei, as well as other domestic players such as Vivo, Xiaomi and Honor.
That has raised worries that customers may push device purchases from the all-important holiday season to next year, delaying a potential boost to sales from AI.
In the September quarter, Apple is expected to report a 3.8% increase in iPhone sales, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. That would snap two quarters of decline.
Its overall revenue is expected to rise 5.7% in the July-September period, which makes up its fiscal fourth quarter, LSEG data showed.
Revenue from Greater China is expected to rise 6.6%. Some iPhone models, including a version of the iPhone 16 Plus, had discounts of 10% on online retail platform Pinduoduo ahead of the model's official release, according to local reports.
That as well as the iPhone 16 series helped Apple finish with the second-largest share of the Chinese market in the three months to September, according to IDC data.
Sales of iPad are set to rise 10.1% to $7.09 billion after a 23.7% jump in the prior three months, powered by launches of more powerful versions of the tablet.
The services business - which includes its App Store and usually outpaces growth in Apple's devices - is expected to see a 13.3% rise in sales, a tad slower than the prior quarter.
The business faces rising hurdles after European Union antitrust regulators charged Apple with breaching the bloc's tech rules in June.
Apple's lucrative deal with Alphabet that makes Google the default search engine in iOS is also facing scrutiny in the U.S.
Its fourth-quarter results will also include a one-time income-tax charge of about $10 billion after Europe's top court ruled against Apple in September in its court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland."

Automotive accounts for almost a quarter of total sales at TDK, which was founded in 1935, with the company a leading supplier of components such as ceramic capacitors and temperature sensors.
While many fans remain wedded to Formula One with the signature sound of its internal combustion engines, interest in Formula E is growing.

Indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to contain at least 40% of parts manufactured locally and the iPhone 16 has not met the requirement, ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arief said in a statement issued on Friday.
""Imported iPhone 16 hardwares cannot be marketed in the country, because Apple Indonesia has not fulfilled its investment commitment to earn a local content certification,"" he said, adding that the phones can still be brought from abroad for personal use as long as users pay the necessary taxes.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company's iPhone 16 phones were <a href=""/technology/apple-iphone-16-event-key-announcements-so-far-2024-09-09/"">first released</a> in September.

Indonesia has a huge, tech-savvy population, making the Southeast Asian nation a key target market for tech-related investment.
During a <a href=""/technology/apple-ceo-says-looking-into-possibility-building-manufacturing-facility-2024-04-17/"">visit</a> by Apple's CEO Tim Cook to Indonesia last April, Indonesia's Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said he hoped the tech giant would increase its local content by partnering with domestic firms.
Companies usually increase the domestic requirement through such local partnerships or by sourcing parts domestically.
Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, but since 2018 it has been setting up app developer academies, which including the new academy have a total cost of 1.6 trillion rupiah ($101.8 million).

Nvidia's stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion, while that of Apple was $3.52 trillion, according to data from LSEG.
In June, Nvidia <a href=""/markets/us/nvidia-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-06-18/"">briefly became</a> the world's most valuable company, before it was overtaken by Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft's market value stood at $3.20 trillion.
Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion. Nvidia provides chips used to train so-called foundation models such as OpenAI's GPT-4.
""More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
""It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia.""
Nvidia's shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/2330.TW"" target=""_blank"">(2330.TW)</a>, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI.
The next big test will be when Nvidia reports third-quarter results in November. Nvidia in August forecast third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with the current average analyst expectation of $32.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note dated Oct. 10 that he remains ""very bullish"" about the company longer term, but the recent rally ""raises the bar for earnings somewhat"".
After a meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, Moore noted the ramp up in production of its next-generation Blackwell chips appeared to be ""quite strong"" and are booked out for 12 months. The stock came under pressure in August after Nvidia confirmed reports that the production of Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter.
Shares of Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft have an outsized influence on the richly valued technology sector as well as the broader U.S. stock market, with the trio accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500 index's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SPX"" target=""_blank"">(.SPX)</a> weightage.
Frenzy around the prospects of AI, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will considerably bring down interest rates, and most recently, an upbeat start to the earnings season, have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to an all-time high last week.
Nvidia's massive gains have helped boost the stock's appeal for option traders and the company's options are among the most traded on any given day in recent months, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.
The stock has surged nearly 190% so far this year as a boom in generative AI prompted the company to issue a series of blowout forecasts.
""The question is whether the revenue stream will last for a long time and will be driven by the emotion of investors rather than by any ability to prove or disprove the thesis that AI is overdone,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""I think Nvidia knows that near term, their numbers are likely to be quite remarkable."""

Sales for the device have been waning after initial enthusiasm following its launch in February, due to the headset's hefty price tag and competition from cheaper options including Meta Platforms' <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O"" target=""_blank"">(META.O)</a> Quest.
While Apple's Vision Pro starts at around $3,500 in the U.S., Meta's Quest 3 headset has a price tag of around $500.
According to the Information report, employees at three Vision Pro suppliers have so far built enough components to make between 500,000 and 600,000 headsets. One of the employees said their factory suspended production of Vision Pro components in May.
Apple in recent weeks has also told the device's assembler, Luxshare, that it might need to wind down its manufacturing in November, the report said, citing an employee at the manufacturer.
The iPhone maker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Information had <a href=""/technology/apple-suspends-work-next-high-end-headset-focus-cheaper-model-information-2024-06-18/"">reported</a> in June that Apple was working on releasing a more affordable Vision product with fewer features before the end of 2025 and suspended work on its next high-end headset.
Apple launched the Vision Pro in international markets earlier this year to reinvigorate demand at a time when it rushes to incorporate artificial intelligence into its flagship mobile devices to get ahead of rivals."

China is the world's biggest smartphone market where, in recent quarters, the iPhone maker has been losing market share to domestic rivals.
Apple began China sales of its <a href=""/technology/huaweis-2800-tri-fold-phone-hits-stores-amid-supply-concerns-2024-09-20/"">latest smartphones</a> on Sept. 20, the same day local champion Huawei (HWT.UL) launched a rival handset. The new iPhones got off to a strong start with sales rising 20% in the first three weeks of launch compared with the year-earlier model, showed data from researcher Counterpoint.
However, overall iPhone sales in China fell 2% on year during the three-week period due to declining sales of older models and increased competition with Huawei's Mate and Pura series, Counterpoint said."

The new iPad mini is powered by Apple's A17 Pro chip, which is used in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. With a six-core central processing unit, the A17 Pro would boost CPU performance by 30% compared to the current generation iPad minis and is central to running Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software.
Apple said it would roll out the first set of AI features in the U.S. version of the English language this month through a software update with iPadOS 18.1.
The features will be available for iPads with A17 Pro or M1 chips and later generations, Apple said, adding it will roll out additional features including image-generation tools, Genmoji and ChatGPT-powered capabilities over the next several months.

Still, research firm Canalys on Monday said the iPhone 16 would help Apple's sales in the fourth quarter and drive momentum into the first half of 2025, after Apple reached a record high third-quarter shipments.

With investors betting on strong demand for its next-generation Blackwell AI processors, the Santa Clara, California company's stock climbed 2.8% to $138.57, just short of its intraday record high of $140.76 on June 20.
In June, Nvidia <a href=""/markets/us/nvidia-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-06-18/"">briefly became</a> the world's most valuable company. It was overtaken by Microsoft, and the tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.
The latest gains lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.4 trillion, just below Apple's $3.5 trillion value and above Microsoft's $3.1 trillion.
Nvidia has been Wall Street's biggest winner from a race between Alphabet <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O"" target=""_blank"">(GOOGL.O)</a>, Microsoft, Amazon <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O"" target=""_blank"">(AMZN.O)</a> and other major tech companies to dominate emerging AI technology.
""We believe the major companies in AI ... face an investment environment characterized by a Prisoner's Dilemma — each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are (potentially) devastating,"" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a report on Sunday.
TD Cowen reiterated its $165 price target for Nvidia, which it called its ""Top Pick"".

Analysts expect spending to build out AI data centers will help Nvidia's annual revenue more than double to nearly $126 billion, according to LSEG data.
While Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, investors worry optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology."

The NLRB complaint, which was issued on Thursday, accuses Apple of maintaining unlawful work rules around the acceptable uses of Slack, <a href=""/technology/apples-alleged-restriction-workers-slack-use-sparks-labor-complaint-2021-12-07/"">illegally firing an employee</a> who advocated for workplace changes on Slack, requiring another worker to delete a social media post, and creating the impression that employees were being surveilled via social media.
This is the second time the NLRB has hit Apple with a complaint this month. Last week the agency <a href=""/technology/apple-accused-by-us-labor-board-imposing-illegal-workplace-rules-2024-10-01/"">accused the company</a> of requiring employees nationwide to sign illegal confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements and of imposing overly broad misconduct and social media policies.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In response to last week's complaint, the company denied wrongdoing and said it respects its employees' rights to discuss wages, hours and working conditions.
An administrative judge will hold an initial hearing in the case in February if Apple does not settle. The judge's decision can be reviewed by the five-member labor board, whose rulings can be appealed in federal court.
The new case stems from a complaint filed with the NLRB nearly three years ago by Janneke Parrish, who says Apple fired her in 2021 for playing a lead role in employee activism.
Parrish used Slack and public social media outlets to advocate for permanent remote work, distribute a pay equity survey, detail alleged sex and race discrimination at Apple and post open letters critical of the company, according to the new complaint.
Slack, which allows workers to create group conversations, was rolled out several years ago at Apple and became increasingly popular as a discussion forum during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The NLRB complaint says Apple has a policy barring workers from creating new Slack channels without permission from managers. Posts about workplace concerns must be directed to a manager or a ""People Support"" group, according to the complaint.
Laurie Burgess, Parrish's lawyer, said in an email on Friday that Apple had engaged in ""extensive violations"" of workers' rights.

The National Labor Relations Board in the complaint announced late on Monday claims Apple required employees nationwide to sign illegal confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements and imposed overly broad misconduct and social media policies.
The complaint accuses Apple of ""interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of"" their rights under federal labor law.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If Apple does not settle the claims, the case will be heard by an administrative judge beginning in January. The agency is seeking to require Apple to rescind the allegedly unlawful rules and notify its entire U.S. workforce of their legal rights.
Administrative judges' decisions can be reviewed by the five-member labor board, whose rulings can be appealed to federal appeals courts.
The complaint stems from <a href=""/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"">charges filed against Apple</a> in 2021 by Ashley Gjovik, a former senior engineering manager at the company. Gjovik said various Apple rules, including those relating to confidentiality and social media use, <a href=""/technology/apple-workplace-rules-violate-us-labor-law-agency-finds-2023-01-31/"">deter employees from discussing issues</a> such as pay equity and sex discrimination with each other and the media.
Gjovik also filed a lawsuit in California federal court in May accusing Apple of illegally retaliating against her for filing the NLRB complaints and attempting to organize other workers. Apple has denied wrongdoing and has moved to dismiss the case.
The company is facing at least two other pending NLRB cases claiming it fired an employee at its Cupertino, California headquarters for criticizing managers and illegally interfered with a union campaign at a retail store in Atlanta. The company has denied wrongdoing.
The NLRB in May ruled that the manager of an Apple store in Manhattan <a href=""/world/us/apple-interrogation-nyc-worker-about-union-drive-was-illegal-us-labor-board-2024-05-07/"">unlawfully interrogated an employee</a> about his support for a union.

The weekend blaze has caused an <a href=""/technology/tata-iphone-component-plant-halts-production-indefinitely-after-fire-2024-09-30/"">indefinite production halt</a> at Tata's Hosur plant in Tamil Nadu, the only Indian supplier of iPhone back panels and some other parts for both contract manufacturer Foxconn in the country and its own iPhone assembly at another plant.
Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research told Reuters it estimates local sales of 1.5 million units of iPhone 14 and 15 models during the Indian festive season which runs from late October to early November, with Apple struggling to fulfil as much as 15% of that demand due to the fire.
""There will be a 10-15% impact on production of older iPhone models from India. Apple could offset that impact by importing more components, and by re-routing more export inventory towards India,"" said Neil Shah, a co-founder of Counterpoint, which has for years tracked Apple's global shipments.
Apart from local sales, Tata, one of India's biggest conglomerates, also exported iPhones to the Netherlands and United States as well as some parts to China, worth more than $250 million overall, in the year to Aug. 31, commercially available customs data shows.
Tata declined to comment.
Apple suppliers typically carry a three- to four-week stock of back panels, Counterpoint said. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter estimated, however, that Apple was likely to have stock for eight weeks, and therefore would not see an immediate impact.
However, they added that if the production suspension continues, the U.S. company could set up another assembly line in China or add shifts there to secure parts for India's iPhone manufacturers.
Supply chain <a href=""/world/india/past-disruptions-apple-facilities-in-india-2024-09-28/"">disruptions</a> more generally have cast a shadow over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to attract foreign investors to ""Make in India"", especially in the electronics sector.
Apple has been diversifying beyond China but last year separate fire incidents in India caused suppliers Foxlink and Pegatron to briefly halt operations, with authorities finding much of the fire safety equipment at Foxlink's facility <a href=""/technology/apple-supplier-foxlink-unlikely-resume-full-india-operations-two-months-source-2023-02-28/"">was not functional</a>. Contractors Wistron and Foxconn have also been hit by labour unrest in recent years.
""These are temporary setbacks,"" said Prabhu Ram, vice president at Cybermedia Research. ""Continued efforts to improve safety and operational standards are crucial for strengthening India's position as an emerging global electronics manufacturing hub.""
Tata is among Apple's newest suppliers in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total global iPhone shipments this year, up from 12-14% last year.
The fire-hit plant employed 20,000 workers. Another unit in the same Tata complex was due to start making complete iPhones later this year and it is unclear if the incident will cause this to be delayed.
Tata has another iPhone plant near Bengaluru, which it acquired from Wistron last year, and a second one in Tamil Nadu near Chennai, which it is set to acquire <a href=""/markets/deals/pegatron-talks-with-tata-sell-its-only-india-iphone-plant-sources-say-2024-04-08/"">from Pegatron</a>."

Prime Minister Simon Harris must call an election by March but most analysts see November as the most likely date, when voters will start to benefit from the latest budget splurge resulting from Europe's healthiest set of public finances.
A surge in corporate tax revenues mainly paid by a handful of large U.S. multinationals has handed Ireland one of Europe's few budget surpluses, with the added 14 billion euros ($15.62 billion) of Apple back taxes set to push it to <a href=""/markets/europe/irish-budget-surplus-surge-8-national-income-after-apple-windfall-2024-09-27/"">8% of national income</a> this year.

Some EU countries are contemplating spending cuts and tax hikes, but new Irish Finance Minister Jack Chambers has said the average worker will be 1,000 euros better off from the planned income tax cuts and rises in welfare rates, while also stashing money away in a new <a href=""/markets/wealth/why-is-ireland-launching-sovereign-wealth-fund-2023-10-10/"">sovereign wealth fund</a>.
Ministers will again include an added package of ""one-off"" financial supports to help households with the cost of living, even though inflation has fallen to almost zero from 5% a year ago and 9% the year before that.
Ireland has <a href=""/markets/europe/flush-with-multinational-money-ireland-struggles-close-infrastructure-gap-2024-09-27/"">struggled</a> to keep up with the demands of a fast-growing economy and population and make real progress with intractable problems in housing, transport and healthcare despite sharp capital spending increases.
Analysts welcome the commitment to using the windfall gains on persistent deficits in crucial infrastructure, but they say the government needs to get reforms right in areas like planning to really capitalise on its exceptional fiscal position.

Apple made its request on Monday in a <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lbvgjrjkdpq/Epic%20v%20Apple%20--%20injunction%20motion%2020240930.pdf"" target=""_blank"">court filing</a> to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, where the iPhone maker and Epic have faced off for years over Apple's App Store practices.
Epic sued Apple in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law by controlling the market for iPhone apps and overcharging developers through a 30% commission on app transactions. Apple defeated most of the case, but Rogers in a 2021 ruling said Apple must give developers more power to steer app users to payment options outside of Apple’s ecosystem.
In Monday’s filing, Apple said new decisions by California state courts and the U.S. Supreme Court in two unrelated cases bolster the company’s legal arguments against the injunction.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Epic declined to comment.
Citing the new rulings, Apple said its practices were not unfair and that any injunction should be limited to benefiting only Epic, and not other developers.
The other cases included a proposed California consumer class action against Apple over its App Store practices, and an action in U.S. federal court accusing the Biden administration of pressuring social media companies to combat misinformation.
The wrangling comes as Apple fights Epic’s claims that it has <a href=""/legal/epic-games-accuses-apple-violating-app-store-injunction-2024-03-13/"">violated</a> the court’s 2021 order and should be held in contempt. Apple has denied any wrongdoing.
Epic, as part of the contempt fight, has accused Apple of dragging its feet on producing internal corporate documents. Apple’s efforts drew a rebuke last week from a U.S. magistrate judge, who said the company had waited too long to ask for a deadline extension.
“Apple knew it wasn’t on track to make the substantial completion deadline and kept that a secret,” U.S. District Judge Thomas Hixson <a href=""https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1017.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>, accusing the company of ""bad behavior"" aimed at prolonging the case.
The case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-cv-05640.
For Epic: Gary Bornstein and Yonatan Even of Cravath, Swaine & Moore
For Apple: Mark Perry of Weil, Gotshal & Manges; and Cynthia Richman of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher

The factory, for which Sunday was a weekly holiday, is unlikely to receive state permission to resume production by Monday, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Neither Tata Electronics nor Apple responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours. Tata Electronics previously said it was investigating the cause and would take steps to safeguard employees and other stakeholders.
The <a href=""/world/india/past-disruptions-apple-facilities-in-india-2024-09-28/"">incident is the latest</a> in recent years to affect Apple suppliers in India, where the U.S. firm is diversifying its supply chain beyond China and which it sees as a growth market.
The fire at the plant in the city of Hosur began in an area used to store chemicals, a fire official told Reuters.
It has been ""completely put out"" and fumes have stopped, said district administrative official K.M. Sarayu.
Two workers who were hospitalised are likely to be discharged on Sunday, she said.
""We can now go in to investigate,"" Sarayu said, adding that a forensic team from state capital Chennai has been dispatched.
It was not clear if the fire affected surrounding buildings, one of which is set to start assembling iPhones by year-end."

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, dismissed nearly all claims based on the ""Allow Apps to Request to Track"" setting on Apple mobile devices, but let some claims proceed over the ""Share [Device] Analytics"" setting.
Mobile device users said Apple violated their user agreements and several privacy and consumer protection laws by assuring that disabling the settings would limit its collection, storage and use of their data - only to then ignore their choices and collect, store and use that data.
The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages is one of many accusing technology companies such as Apple, Alphabet's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O"" target=""_blank"">(GOOGL.O)</a> Google and Meta Platforms' <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O"" target=""_blank"">(META.O)</a> Facebook of allowing the collection of user data without consent.
In a 39-page decision late Thursday, Davila said Apple made clear to users that the ""Allow Apps to Request to Track"" setting applied to ""other companies' apps and websites.""
He said that made it ""implausible"" for reasonable people to believe that by turning the setting off, they were withdrawing consent for Apple to collect their data through its own apps.
But the judge said users plausibly alleged they withdrew such consent by disabling the ""Share [Device] Analytics"" setting, citing Apple's disclosure that users may ""disable the sharing of Device Analytics altogether.""
The Cupertino, California-based company has said it collects data through that setting to improve its products and services.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The case is In re Apple Data Privacy Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-07069."

Jabil said it would reduce headcount in some divisions as part of its restructuring plan, but did not provide any number.
The company expects to record about $150 million to $200 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs over the fiscal year 2025.
While Jabil faced short-term demand challenges in certain end-markets, it said it was well-positioned to capitalize on the trends in industries ranging from datacenter power and cooling to electric and hybrid vehicles in the mid-to-long term.
The company's revenue for the quarter ended Aug. 31 stood at $6.96 billion, down nearly 18% over the year earlier but above LSEG estimates of $6.58 billion.
On an adjusted basis, Jabil earned $2.30 per share for the quarter, also ahead of analysts' average estimate of $2.20.
The company forecast its net revenue for the fiscal 2025 at $27 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $28.5 billion."

In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also rejected claims that Meta concealed former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's use of company resources on personal matters, including her wedding and her best-selling book ""Lean In.""
The Oakland, California-based judge also turned aside claims that Meta knew its transition to Reels, which copied TikTok's short-form video format, would hurt revenue because it offered fewer ads per hour than older formats.
Shareholders led by four Israeli insurers and pension funds challenged 17 allegedly false and misleading statements that Meta made in 2021 and 2022.
They said Meta's stock price fell 53% in less than a year as the truth came out, wiping out well over $500 billion of the Menlo Park, California-based company's market value.
But in her 34-page decision, Rogers said Meta's eventual admission that Apple's iOS privacy changes could pose a $10 billion ""headwind"" in 2022 did not demonstrate that its earlier disclosures were false.
She also said the claims about Sandberg came ""entirely from press reports"" and were unproven, and found no proof that the transition to Reels hurt Meta's financial performance.
""The court determines plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged violations of federal securities law,"" Rogers wrote.
She dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.
Other defendants included Sandberg, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li and her predecessor David Wehner.

Business travel last year approached pre-pandemic levels but trailed behind leisure trips, as geopolitical conflicts and a slower rebound in key markets hindered full recovery.
Emissions from corporate flights by 26 major tech companies analysed by Travel Smart, a campaign led by Transport & Environment (T&E) dropped by an average of 49% in 2023, it found.
While this shows that many tech firms are on the right path, only seven have set specific reduction targets that are essential to keeping business flight numbers in check, T&E said.
Alphabet, which has not set a goal to cut emissions, and Apple, which set a broader target, are slowly creeping back toward 2019 levels, T&E said.
The two were among the worst performers, with reductions in corporate travel emissions of just 23% and 31% in 2023, respectively.
""How can (Google chief) Sundar Pichai say that Google is progressing to a sustainable future when its travel emissions are going in the wrong direction?"" said Denise Auclair, corporate travel manager at T&E.

""Tech companies have claimed to be climate leaders for a long time and many have substantially reduced their business travel emissions, but if they want to be credible they must set reduction targets,"" Auclair added.
Asked about its performance, Apple said it has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55% since 2015 as part of its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2030.
""We're achieving this by making reductions across our entire carbon footprint — including business travel — and implementing significant cuts to the largest sources of our emissions,"" a spokesperson for Apple told Reuters.
Other companies were not immediately available for comment."

It said it would now begin the process of releasing assets from an escrow fund, estimated at 13.8 billion euros ($15 billion) at the end of last year, after the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ordered the recovery of the funds from Apple.
Ireland has long fought a 2016 European Commission order that said the iPhone maker benefited from two Irish tax rulings for over two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014.
""The CJEU has found that the tax paid was insufficient and that a greater amount of taxation was required to be recovered,"" the statement said.
""The Irish position has always been that Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers.""
Since the EU order in 2016, Ireland has changed rules regarding corporate residence, the attribution of profits to branches of non-resident companies operating in the state and has adapted its tax rules in line with international agreements, the statement said.

WHAT HAPPENED?
In 2016, the European Commission’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager accused Ireland of having granted Apple illegal tax benefits, unfairly diverting investment away from other countries.
Both Apple and Ireland, whose low tax rates helped it attract Big Tech companies to set up their European headquarters, successfully challenged the EU ruling.
But the European Court of Justice has now <a href=""/technology/apple-loses-fight-against-13-billion-euro-eu-tax-order-ireland-2024-09-10/"">sided with Vestager</a>, agreeing Apple had unduly benefited from unfair loopholes in Ireland's tax regime, and that the company must now hand Ireland 13 billion euros in back payments.

WHAT WAS THE 'DOUBLE IRISH' SCHEME?
Part of Ireland's success in luring tech giants was a result of its old tax regime, under which multinational businesses were able to cut their overseas contributions to single digits.
The arrangement involved a complex corporate structure whereby a multinational could channel untaxed revenues to an Irish subsidiary which then pays the money to another company registered in Ireland but taxed elsewhere, such as tax haven Bermuda.
Both companies being Irish led to the term ""Double Irish"".
Apple used a version of the Double Irish scheme until around 2014 when, under sustained pressure from the EU and U.S., Ireland closed the loophole.

WHAT DID APPLE SAY?
Apple expressed disappointment with the ruling, which is final and cannot be appealed.
""The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the U.S.,"" the company said.

HOW IS IRELAND GOING TO SPEND THE CASH?
In its initial statement, the Irish government did not say. It will likely be placed into a new sovereign wealth fund that Dublin set up last year to invest surging corporate tax receipts that have handed it one of the few budget surpluses in Europe.
The government already plans to cut taxes and increase spending again in a pre-election Oct. 1 budget. Opposition parties have repeated calls that the Apple tax receipts should be used to further boost spending now on strained services.

WILL OTHER COMPANIES BE FORCED TO PAY BACK TAXES?
The Commission's case against Ireland was helped by its ability to secure access to documents in which Irish officials were <a href=""/article/business/why-the-eu-says-apple-must-pay-ireland-145-billion-in-tax-idUSKCN1151Z4/"">unusually frank</a> about the agreement they made with Apple.

However, Jefferies analysts said in a note that Apple's move was not a concern for hearing aid players as over-the-counter (OTC) devices target a different population.
OTC hearing aids do not compete against prescription-based devices on either technological or service levels, despite their attractive price points, Jefferies added.
""The level of fitting does not suffice the need for those, that have severe hearing aid problems and as such, OTC devices are mostly used for those with mild hearing aid problems,"" analysts from Vontobel wrote in a note.
Still, analysts said the news could be a positive development for the hearing aid industry, as it also raises awareness of the hearing deterioration problems."

Here are some products tech behemoth Apple launched at the event:

NEW IPHONE LINEUP
The iPhone 16, starting at $799, comes in two sizes -- 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. The phones are powered by the new A18 chips, which feature a 16-core neural engine designed for generative AI-linked tasks and Apple Intelligence.
The phones also come with a customizable action button, allowing users to perform a variety of functions such as recording voice memo, identifying songs, and translating phrases.

APPLE WATCH UPGRADES
Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 10 starting at $399, which the company claims is its thinnest and fastest charging watch ever.
The Series 10 will be powered by Apple's new S10 chip, which includes a four-core neural engine that will allow machine learning activities and power features such as double tapping on device, Siri dictation, along with crash and fall detection.
Apple also highlighted the health-linked features of its watch, such as sleep apnea detection. The watch will monitor a new metric during sleep called breathing disturbances and will notify users if they display signs of sleep apnea.

AIRPOD MODELS
Apple's AirPods 4, powered by a new custom H2 chip, start at $129 and come with improved audio quality and personalized spatial audio.
Users can also interact with Siri while using the AirPods by nodding ""yes"" or shaking their head to say ""no"" in response to Siri announcements. The charging case has USB-C ports.
The company also said that its AirPods Pro 2 can now be ""transformed"" into a personalized hearing aid via an upcoming software update, boosting the specific sounds in real time, like parts of speech or elements within a user's environment."

The event at the tech giant's Apple Park headquarters at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 GMT) follows its <a href=""/technology/ai-is-sole-focus-apples-annual-conference-2024-06-10/"">developer conference</a> in June during which the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.
It had also showed off an improved version of voice assistant Siri, featuring an integration with ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> OpenAI.
The refresh comes as iPhones face stiff <a href=""/technology/huaweis-china-smartphone-shipments-leap-while-apple-share-dips-2024-07-25/"">competition from Huawei</a> (HWT.UL) in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them. Huawei itself has scheduled its own product announcement mere hours after Apple's event.
Apple Intelligence must be approved by Beijing in order to be released in the Chinese market. In July, OpenAI blocked access to ChatGPT in China, a move that could impact the chatbot's integration into Siri.
""The Chinese market is hungrier for AI features than the U.S. market,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. ""It will be very difficult to bring it to China immediately, so they'll be going off the merits of the hardware.""
IPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's $383 billion sales last year, and the new devices are an important update for the Cupertino, California-based company that is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a <a href=""/technology/apples-ai-push-could-reinvigorate-iphone-sales-customers-look-upgrade-2024-06-11/"">slowdown in iPhone sales</a>.
In China, Apple aggressively <a href=""/technology/apple-slashes-iphone-prices-china-amid-fierce-huawei-competition-2024-05-20/"">slashed prices</a> earlier this year, prompted by <a href=""/technology/china-moves-widen-state-employee-iphone-curbs-sources-2023-09-07/"">government restrictions</a> and <a href=""/technology/huawei-flagship-store-surge-china-signals-showdown-with-apple-2024-05-15/"">increased domestic competition</a>.
The iPhone 16 lineup will be the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features, though those will also be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices. New versions of the Apple Watch and AirPods are also expected.
""The software side, and how Apple frames it, is the biggest question,"" said Bajarin. ""Investors will look for if it's compelling enough to have a larger than normal upgrade cycle.""
Rivals including Alphabet's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O"" target=""_blank"">(GOOGL.O)</a> Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apple's dominance in the high-end smartphone market.
Google, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apple's iOS, traditionally announced its Pixel smartphones in the autumn. This year, it pushed <a href=""/technology/google-unveils-new-phones-other-gadgets-powered-by-ai-2024-08-13/"">the event</a> to August ahead of Apple's announcement.
Google focused on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/005930.KS"" target=""_blank"">(005930.KS)</a> and Motorola <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSI.N"" target=""_blank"">(MSI.N)</a>.
""The question is who is going to be the first to combine a truly personal AI assistant with knowledge and information that is accurate and personalized,"" said Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst for TECHnalysis Research.
Apple has so far shared a timeline for the release of Apple Intelligence only in the United States, where it is slated to launch on compatible devices in the autumn.
In June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would <a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/apple-delay-launch-ai-powered-features-europe-blames-eu-tech-rules-2024-06-21/"">delay the release in Europe</a> due to European Union tech rules."

The bid to grab a slice of in-person purchases at stores, cafes and restaurants is part of <a href=""/technology/persistent-competition-likely-keep-pressure-paypal-analysts-say-2024-07-31/"">an ambitious</a> turnaround strategy by new CEO Alex Chriss who joined the company from Intuit last year.
While PayPal has long dominated online payments and peer-to-peer payments via its Venmo app, it has not pushed consumers to use its products in person.
""E-commerce has obviously been one of the fastest growing areas where people are spending their dollars... but it's not everything,"" Chriss said. ""Now consumers can use PayPal for every purchase, everywhere, every time.""
The push into point-of-sales includes 5% cash back for certain products up to $1,000 per month and additional rewards from brands like DoorDash and Sephora.
The value of U.S. debit card payments has jumped in recent years, reaching $4.55 trillion in 2021 up from $2.47 trillion in 2015, according to recent U.S. Federal Reserve data.
Chriss said consumers are becoming increasingly cost-conscious and moving towards debit cards, which allow them to keep within their spending limits.
PayPal will also allow customers to use debit cards with Apple Pay, as users take advantage of mobile wallets and ""tap to pay"" options.
That makes it among the more competitive debit card cash-back products with only 24% of debit cardholders reporting earning cash-back rewards in 2023, compared with 74% of credit cardholders, a report from purchase rewards firm Valuedynamx showed.
While PayPal has enjoyed a long-held first mover advantage, increasing competition from Apple and Google have taken some share in mobile payments, <a href=""/technology/persistent-competition-likely-keep-pressure-paypal-analysts-say-2024-07-31/"">according to analysts</a>.
As part of the push, the company is making its largest-ever marketing investment to promote using PayPal in person. PayPal declined to disclose amount of that investment, but flagged in its quarterly earnings that marketing and brand campaigns would push up expenses in the second half of the year.
Chriss has called 2024 a ""transition year"" for PayPal, and has promised to grow revenues beyond transaction-related volume. In January, PayPal launched <a href=""/business/paypal-launch-ai-based-products-new-ceo-aims-revive-share-price-2024-01-25/"">artificial intelligence-driven products</a> and a one-click checkout feature.
PayPal's stock price is up more than 17% since the beginning of the year, but still trails benchmark S&P 500 index's 22% gain."

The U.S. technology giant, working to boost revenue globally from <a href=""/technology/apple-revenue-returns-growth-iphone-sales-top-expectations-2024-08-01/"">services</a> including apps, payments and media, is set to offer <a href=""/business/media-telecom/indias-bharti-airtel-announces-content-partnership-with-apple-2024-08-27/"">free music and video streaming</a> to many of Bharti Airtel's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BRTI.NS"" target=""_blank"">(BRTI.NS)</a> 281 million customers.
The deal is likely to greatly expand the user base for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in a country where Apple has long emphasised the manufacturing side of business to diversify its supply chain beyond China.
Apple builds many of its iPhones in India yet its handsets make up just 6% of the country's 690 million smartphones, versus around 2% in 2019, Counterpoint Research data showed.
""The move speaks of Apple's ambitions for India,"" said Nitesh Kripalani, former head of Amazon Prime Video in India. ""The strategy is a time-tested method to catapult presence in markets it considers important.""
In the U.S., Apple has offered <a href=""/article/technology/verizon-deepens-ties-with-apple-offers-free-apple-music-to-some-us-customers-idUSKCN1PA08H/"">Apple Music for free</a> via some Verizon <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/VZ.N"" target=""_blank"">(VZ.N)</a> mobile data plans since 2019, and its Apple TV+ will feature in a Comcast <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/CMCSA.O"" target=""_blank"">(CMCSA.O)</a> <a href=""/business/media-telecom/comcast-unveil-netflix-apple-tv-peacock-streaming-bundle-2024-05-14/"">streaming bundle</a> from May.
In India, Apple Music will become available to premium users of Airtel's Wynk music app, which will eventually close.
Postpaid Airtel contracts give about 7 million subscribers access to the ad-free version of Wynk but only a small fraction use it, said a telecom industry source who declined to be named as the figures are confidential.
Neither Apple nor Airtel responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.

MUSIC BATTLEGROUND
Apple Music is more tailored to the Indian market compared with the mostly English Apple TV+ with content including Bollywood and regional-language songs, though its library is smaller than Spotify's, said Counterpoint co-founder Neil Shah.
Spotify has some 3 million paid users in India, Gaana has 1.4 million, Wynk 500,000 and Apple Music 200,000, said an Indian music industry source who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to share estimates publicly.
Neither Spotify nor Gaana responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.
Overall, only around 7.5 million people paid for audio streaming services in India last year out of about 185 million users of ad-supported and ad-free apps, showed data from industry group FICCI and consultants EY.
Airtel will pay Apple a per-user fee ""significantly"" lower than the monthly $1.20 charged each for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in India, said the telecom industry source.
In return, it will save millions of rupees in licensing as it looks to shut Wynk and use Apple Music to boost revenue and improve customer loyalty, said a second telecom source
""Airtel realised its strength is distribution, not content creation,"" said the source on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the matter.

VIDEO STREAMING
Apple is a small player in <a href=""/business/media-telecom/top-streaming-platforms-content-hungry-india-2024-08-28/"">Indian video streaming</a>, with Counterpoint estimating it has fewer than 1 million users. Disney+ Hotstar is the market leader with 38 million users, while estimates showed Netflix <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NFLX.O"" target=""_blank"">(NFLX.O)</a> has around 10 million.
Hinting at the market's potential, Netflix has repeatedly said it targets 100 million users, without fixing a time frame.
Apple TV+ is known for original series such as ""The Morning Show"" and ""Slow Horses"" however rivals including Netflix and Disney feature more Hindi content with Bollywood actors and even regional-language films.
Disney and Reliance Industries' <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RELI.NS"" target=""_blank"">(RELI.NS)</a> JioCinema also stream cricket - India's most popular sport - and the two companies are <a href=""/world/india/india-competition-regulator-approves-85-bln-disney-reliance-media-assets-merger-2024-08-28/"">merging their Indian media assets</a> to create the nation's biggest entertainment firm.
Airtel, which as telecoms provider lags only Reliance Jio by subscribers, plans to offer packages with several months' free access to Apple TV+, said the second telecoms source.
Though that will get Apple TV+ into more homes, growth could be hindered as its ""offering is still not optimised locally that much,"" said Counterpoint's Shah."

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href=""https://tmsnrt.rs/3MpP9NG"" target=""_blank"">upheld a Wisconsin federal court's 2022 ruling</a> that the school was not entitled to a new trial following the appeals court's 2018 decision to wipe out a jury's verdict in its favor.
The Federal Circuit rejected the university's argument that it should have been allowed to raise a new infringement theory after the appeals court's 2018 ruling, finding that the school should have presented the theory during the original trial.
Attorneys and spokespeople for Apple and the university did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.
The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), the school's patent licensing arm, sued Apple in 2014, arguing that chips used in iPhones and iPads violated its patent rights in technology for improving processor performance.
A Wisconsin jury awarded WARF $234 million in damages in 2015, and U.S. District Judge William Conley increased the award to more than $506 million in 2017.
The Federal Circuit <a href=""/article/technology/apple-wins-reversal-in-university-of-wisconsin-patent-lawsuit-idUSKCN1M81TV/"">overturned the jury's patent infringement decision</a> in 2018. WARF asked for a new trial in Wisconsin the next year.
Conley <a href=""/legal/litigation/apple-defeats-new-trial-bid-after-overturning-506-mln-patent-verdict-2022-05-11/"">rejected WARF's request</a> in 2022. A unanimous three-judge Federal Circuit panel agreed with Conley on Wednesday.
The case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Apple Inc, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1884.

Analysts see a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series and Apple is expected to launch what they call the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone. It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services.
The new launches come as Apple <a href=""/technology/apple-revenue-returns-growth-iphone-sales-top-expectations-2024-08-01/"">forecasts</a> more gains, betting on AI to attract buyers even as its overall China business disappointed in the third quarter.
Sales in Apple's third-largest market China declined 6.5%, wider than expectations of a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha.
During its annual developer conference in June, Apple unveiled a long-awaited AI strategy, <a href=""/technology/ai-is-sole-focus-apples-annual-conference-2024-06-10/"">integrating</a> its new ""Apple Intelligence"" technology across its suite of apps, including Siri and bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices.
Apple still remains overly reliant on sales of the iPhone and some analysts said any boost from the new AI features was unlikely to materialize in the short term."

The iPhone maker came under pressure from regulators to make changes after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act took effect on March 7, forcing it to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers on a ""choice screen"" the first time they open Safari.
In an update later this year, Apple users will be able to select a default browser directly from the choice screen after going through a mandatory list of options.
A randomly ordered list of 12 browsers per EU country will be shown to the user with short descriptions, and the chosen one will be automatically downloaded, Apple said. The choice screen will also be available on iPads through an update later this year.
Apple released a previous update in response to the new rules in March, but browser companies <a href=""/technology/eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-browsers-gain-market-share-2024-04-10/"">criticized</a> the design of its choice screen, and the Commission <a href=""/business/media-telecom/eu-investigate-apple-google-meta-potential-digital-markets-act-breaches-2024-03-25/"">opened an investigation</a> on March 25 saying it suspected that the measures fell short of effective compliance.
""We welcome Apple's updated choice screen, particularly as it precedes the upcoming iPhone launches,"" Andrew Frost Moroz, founder of Aloha browser, told Reuters.
""For those less familiar with us, the description will highlight these benefits, and fewer taps to start browsing will enhance the user experience and benefit third-party browsers,"" he said.
Apple said it has been in dialogue with the European Commission and believes the new changes will address regulators' concerns.
The Commission said on Thursday it will monitor the effectiveness of the solutions in achieving the objective of the DMA and will decide on the next steps in the open case.
It also plans to introduce a dedicated area for default apps where a user will be able to set defaults for messaging, phone calls, spam filters, password managers and keyboards.
Users will also be able to delete certain Apple-made apps such as App Store, Messages, Camera, Photos and Safari. Only Settings and Phone apps would not be deletable."

Tencent Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell on Thursday confirmed that the two companies were in discussions about revenue sharing on so-called mini-games, or titles played directly on WeChat. Many titles can be played without users having to download them from an app store. These apps-within-an-app have taken off since Tencent introduced them six years ago: over half a billion WeChat users play mini-games at least once a month, the company <a href=""https://companies.caixin.com/2024-07-17/102216928.html"" target=""_blank"">revealed</a> at a developer conference in July, and advertising revenue from mini-games now account for 15% of WeChat's total.
The bigger windfall for the duo could be in-app transactions, or sales of digital goods and services purchased within mini-games. For normal apps, Apple would typically take a 30% cut. Mitchell confirmed that Tencent currently doesn't monetise its mini-games on Apple's operating system via in-app transactions, but also added that it would be in everyone's interest if there was a way to do so ""on terms that we think are economically sustainable and that are also fair"".
A lot could be at stake. The recently released Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile game, for instance, as an app grossed over $500 million in sales its first month across Apple and Android platforms, according to research firm Niko Partners. If a mini-game achieved even half of that monthly spending, a 30% commission fee would equal just shy of $1 billion of annual sales.
For Apple, the extra revenue would be welcome. Greater China sales have fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters and the iPhone is ceding market share to local rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/1810.HK"" target=""_blank"">(1810.HK)</a>. Tencent would benefit too and can drive a hard bargain, not least because the Cupertino giant is also under scrutiny in Europe and elsewhere on its app store practices. Apple is on a delicate non-virtual battleground.

CONTEXT NEWS
China's Tencent on Aug. 14 said it was in talks with Apple about sharing revenue from mini-games played on its all-in-one WeChat messaging app.
Speaking on a call with analysts following second-quarter earnings results, the Chinese company's chief strategy officer, James Mitchell, said it would be in Tencent's and Apple's interest if there was a way to offer in-app transactions on mini-games, but ""on terms that we think are economically sustainable and that are also fair"".
Separately, Apple has demanded Tencent and ByteDance close loopholes that allow app developers to circumvent Apple's typical 30% commission on in-app transactions, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 2, citing people familiar with the matter."

The opposing coalitions of plaintiffs lawyers on Thursday made their pitches to U.S. District Judge Julien Neals in New Jersey, who is presiding over private antitrust cases that were <a href=""/legal/apple-antitrust-suit-mirrors-strategy-that-beat-microsoft-tech-industry-has-2024-03-22/"">filed against Apple</a> after the U.S. Justice Department and a coalition of states sued the iPhone maker in March.
The firms seeking to represent consumers who bought iPhones from Apple include Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, Girard Sharp, Seeger Weiss and Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Brody & Agnello on one side, with Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey on the other.
At stake is the chance to win an outsized share of legal fees stemming from any settlement of judgment in the consolidated case, which could be worth billions of dollars if it succeeds. The firms all have a track record of securing large antitrust recoveries.
The civil cases mirror the Justice Department’s complaint, which accused Apple of violating antitrust law by using contractual restrictions to force developers to play by its rules. The lawsuits allege Apple has set up roadblocks diminishing consumer choice for third-party services.
Cupertino, California-based Apple has denied the government’s claims and <a href=""/legal/apple-asks-us-judge-toss-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-08-01/"">asked the court</a> to throw them out. Apple has not responded yet in the consumer cases. Apple and its defense lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Lawyers at the plaintiffs firms vying to lead the cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/akveorjlovr/Hagens%20Berman%20et%20al%20Apple%20leadership-doc.pdf"" target=""_blank"">their pitch</a>, Hagens Berman's Steven Berman and his team said their rivals' coalition ""would place the fate of this groundbreaking case in the hands"" of just two law firms. They called that proposal “unrealistic” given the complexity, size and stakes of the case.
Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey in their <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgponeydkvd/Hausfeld-Susman-Godfrey-Apple.pdf"" target=""_blank"">counter proposal</a> said the interests of the class in a single-defendant case would not “be served by the inefficiencies that come from a sprawling, multi-firm, multi-layered leadership structure.” The two firms touted their ""efficient, lean leadership structure.""
A third set of firms, facing no opposition, have asked to represent “indirect” purchasers such as consumers who bought an iPhone from a mobile phone carrier. Those <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/byvrqdbampe/Berger-Montague-et-al-Apple-2024.pdf"" target=""_blank"">law firms include</a> Schneider Wallace Cottrell Konecky and Berger Montague.
A coalition of several other firms, including Korein Tillery, MoloLamken and Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, asked to lead a class of only <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/byvrqdbympe/Apple-Watch-direct-purchaser-2024.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Apple Watch purchasers</a>.

Tencent Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell on Thursday confirmed that the two companies were in discussions about revenue sharing on so-called mini-games, or titles played directly on WeChat. Many titles can be played without users having to download them from an app store. These apps-within-an-app have taken off since Tencent introduced them six years ago: over half a billion WeChat users play mini-games at least once a month, the company <a href=""https://companies.caixin.com/2024-07-17/102216928.html"" target=""_blank"">revealed</a> at a developer conference in July, and advertising revenue from mini-games now account for 15% of WeChat's total.
The bigger windfall for the duo could be in-app transactions, or sales of digital goods and services purchased within mini-games. For normal apps, Apple would typically take a 30% cut. Mitchell confirmed that Tencent currently doesn't monetise its mini-games on Apple's operating system via in-app transactions, but also added that it would be in everyone's interest if there was a way to do so ""on terms that we think are economically sustainable and that are also fair"".
A lot could be at stake. The recently released Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile game, for instance, as an app grossed over $500 million in sales its first month across Apple and Android platforms, according to research firm Niko Partners. If a mini-game achieved even half of that monthly spending, a 30% commission fee would equal just shy of $1 billion of annual sales.
For Apple, the extra revenue would be welcome. Greater China sales have fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters and the iPhone is ceding market share to local rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/1810.HK"" target=""_blank"">(1810.HK)</a>. Tencent would benefit too and can drive a hard bargain, not least because the Cupertino giant is also under scrutiny in Europe and elsewhere on its app store practices. Apple is on a delicate non-virtual battleground.

CONTEXT NEWS
China's Tencent on Aug. 14 said it was in talks with Apple about sharing revenue from mini-games played on its all-in-one WeChat messaging app.
Speaking on a call with analysts following second-quarter earnings results, the Chinese company's chief strategy officer, James Mitchell, said it would be in Tencent's and Apple's interest if there was a way to offer in-app transactions on mini-games, but ""on terms that we think are economically sustainable and that are also fair"".
Separately, Apple has demanded Tencent and ByteDance close loopholes that allow app developers to circumvent Apple's typical 30% commission on in-app transactions, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 2, citing people familiar with the matter."

The opposing coalitions of plaintiffs lawyers on Thursday made their pitches to U.S. District Judge Julien Neals in New Jersey, who is presiding over private antitrust cases that were <a href=""/legal/apple-antitrust-suit-mirrors-strategy-that-beat-microsoft-tech-industry-has-2024-03-22/"">filed against Apple</a> after the U.S. Justice Department and a coalition of states sued the iPhone maker in March.
The firms seeking to represent consumers who bought iPhones from Apple include Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, Girard Sharp, Seeger Weiss and Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Brody & Agnello on one side, with Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey on the other.
At stake is the chance to win an outsized share of legal fees stemming from any settlement of judgment in the consolidated case, which could be worth billions of dollars if it succeeds. The firms all have a track record of securing large antitrust recoveries.
The civil cases mirror the Justice Department’s complaint, which accused Apple of violating antitrust law by using contractual restrictions to force developers to play by its rules. The lawsuits allege Apple has set up roadblocks diminishing consumer choice for third-party services.
Cupertino, California-based Apple has denied the government’s claims and <a href=""/legal/apple-asks-us-judge-toss-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-08-01/"">asked the court</a> to throw them out. Apple has not responded yet in the consumer cases. Apple and its defense lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Lawyers at the plaintiffs firms vying to lead the cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/akveorjlovr/Hagens%20Berman%20et%20al%20Apple%20leadership-doc.pdf"" target=""_blank"">their pitch</a>, Hagens Berman's Steven Berman and his team said their rivals' coalition ""would place the fate of this groundbreaking case in the hands"" of just two law firms. They called that proposal “unrealistic” given the complexity, size and stakes of the case.
Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey in their <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgponeydkvd/Hausfeld-Susman-Godfrey-Apple.pdf"" target=""_blank"">counter proposal</a> said the interests of the class in a single-defendant case would not “be served by the inefficiencies that come from a sprawling, multi-firm, multi-layered leadership structure.” The two firms touted their ""efficient, lean leadership structure.""
A third set of firms, facing no opposition, have asked to represent “indirect” purchasers such as consumers who bought an iPhone from a mobile phone carrier. Those <a href=""https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/byvrqdbampe/Berger-Montague-et-al-Apple-2024.pdf"" target=""_blank"">law firms include</a> Schneider Wallace Cottrell Konecky and Berger Montague.

The Commission had <a href=""/technology/apples-app-store-rules-breach-eu-tech-rules-eu-regulators-say-2024-06-24/"">said</a> that under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through ""link-outs"", meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract.
Apple said developers will now be able to communicate and promote offers that are available anywhere, not just on their own website, from within their app.
However, Apple will introduce two new fees - an initial 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store services fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within the 12 months of the app installation.
Currently, Apple charges three types of fees: a core technology fee for the less than 1% of apps, a reduced commission for all digital goods and services sold through the App Store, and an optional fee for the payments and commerce services.
The two new fees will replace the reduced commission for all digital goods and services sold through the App Store.
Spotify <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SPOT.N"" target=""_blank"">(SPOT.N)</a>, which has been at loggerheads with Apple over in-app links, said it was assessing Apple's proposal.
""At first glance, by demanding as much as a 25% fee for basic communication with users, Apple once again blatantly disregards the fundamental requirements of the Digital Markets Act,"" a Spotify spokesperson said.
The Commission had earlier criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration.
""We will assess Apple's eventual changes to the compliance measures, also taking into account any feedback from the market, notably developers,"" a Commission official said.
The charge against Apple is the first by the Commission under its landmark Digital Markets Act which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech and DMA violations could result in a fine of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover."

A potential remedy for Google to avoid antitrust actions could involve terminating the agreement, which makes its search engine a default on Apple devices, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday.
Google pays Apple $20 billion annually, or about 36% of what it earns from search advertising made through the Safari browser, for the privilege, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.
If the deal is undone, the iPhone maker could take a 4-6% hit to its profit, the analysts estimated.
The pact runs until at least September 2026 and Apple has the right to unilaterally extend it for another two years, according to media reports in May that cited a document filed by the Department of Justice in the antitrust case.
""The most likely outcome now is the judge rules Google must no longer pay for default placement or that companies like Apple must proactively prompt users to select their search engine rather than setting a default and allowing consumers to make changes in settings if they wish,"" Evercore ISI analysts said.
Apple's shares were trading flat on Tuesday, underperforming a recovery in the broader market after Monday's global selloff. Alphabet was little changed, after falling 4.5% in the previous session.
""The message here is that if you've got a dominant market position with a product, you'd better avoid the use of exclusive agreements and make sure any agreement you make gives the buyer free choice to substitute away,"" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania.
To be sure, the ""remedy"" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into 2026.

AI TILT
Still, if the tie-up is scrapped, Apple will have several options including offering customers alternatives such as Microsoft Bing to customers, or potentially a new search product powered by OpenAI.
Analysts agree that the ruling will speed up Apple's move towards AI-powered search services. It recently announced that it would bring OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot <a href=""/technology/ai-is-sole-focus-apples-annual-conference-2024-06-10/"">to its devices</a>.
In a shift away from exclusive deals that would help Apple ward off regulatory scrutiny, the company has said it is also in talks with Google to add the Gemini chatbot and plans to add other AI models as well.
Apple is also revamping Siri with AI technology, giving it more control to handle tasks that had proven tricky in the past such as writing emails and interacting with messages.
While those efforts are expected to make little money in the coming years, they could help capitalize on the new technology.
""Apple could see this as a temporary setback, especially since it earns a lot from the Google search deal, but it is also an opportunity for them to pivot to AI solutions for search,"" said Gadjo Sevilla, analyst at Emarketer."

A federal judge <a href=""/technology/landmark-google-ruling-warning-companies-about-preserving-evidence-2024-08-06/"">mostly sided with state and federal antitrust enforcers</a> in the blockbuster case on Monday that ruled Google's search business was an illegal monopoly, but threw out a claim by several U.S. states that one of Google's ad tools was designed to give the company an advantage over Microsoft's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> Bing.
That piece could help Apple's defense in <a href=""/legal/us-takes-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-03-21/"">its own anti-monopoly case</a>, experts said.
The ruling underscored Supreme Court precedent that companies almost never have a ""duty to deal"" with their rivals, said Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.
""Any case, including Apple, in which a duty to deal is a major portion, is going to get a close look,"" he said.
The states had claimed Google thwarted competition by failing to offer key features for rivals' ads through Search Ads 360, a tool for managing marketing campaigns across multiple search engines.
<a href=""/legal/us-judge-describes-how-google-built-defended-illegal-search-monopoly-2024-08-05/"">U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta</a> agreed with Google that it was not required to spur competition by accommodating its rival.
""Their claim requires grappling with a host of questions that the court is ill-equipped to handle,"" the judge said.
That part of the ruling is good for defendants, said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School and former commissioner of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
""It also is a reminder that the case is hardly finished,"" he said, adding that the case and appeals could take years.
To be sure, Apple could ultimately lose billions of dollars because of the Google case if the judge bans the search juggernaut from paying the iPhone maker and others to be the default search engine on their devices.
Mehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.
But the Google ruling could give Apple a boost in its case where the Justice Department says it hampered the development of third-party apps and devices.
The company <a href=""/legal/apple-asks-us-judge-toss-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-08-01/"">last week</a> asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that putting reasonable limitations on third-party developers' access to its technology did not amount to anti-competitive behavior, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.
The judge in Apple's case need not follow Mehta's ruling, though Apple may try to use it to persuade him.
The Justice Department will have to show Apple's interactions with developers were more like Google's payments to device makers, Hovenkamp said.
""In order to win, the government is going to have to point to some kind of agreement, because then the standard becomes more aggressive,"" he said."

Shares of the company rose nearly 1% in extended trading, outperforming other tech stocks that were broadly lower.
Apple is expected to launch this fall what analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone. It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services.
Apple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than analysts' estimates.
Sales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected.
Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview that the iPhone results were better than he had expected three months ago. ""The iPhone 15 family has been doing well from the very beginning and still now - we have three quarters of the year behind us. It is performing better than the previous cycle, the iPhone 14.""
Still, China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%. While that was an improvement from the 8.1% decline in the previous quarter, it was wider than expectations for a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha.
Maestri said China sales fell less than 3%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and added that he feels good about Apple's performance in that country, given any softness in its economy.
Apple has taken to <a href=""/technology/apples-may-smartphone-shipments-china-up-396-yy-data-shows-2024-06-28/"">discounting its iPhones</a> in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei (HWT.UL). The company in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on selected models.

AI PUSH
Analysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September. The company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June.
To operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices.
While some analysts said that some consumers might have purchased the top-end iPhone 15 devices to tap the upcoming Apple Intelligence features, CEO Tim Cook told investors on Thursday it was ""too early to tell"" if that was driving upgrades.
Apple's AI features have arrived later than offerings by rivals including Samsung Electronics <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/005930.KS"" target=""_blank"">(005930.KS)</a>, which has introduced competing devices aimed at hosting AI chatbots. Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> and Alphabet's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O"" target=""_blank"">(GOOGL.O)</a> Google are placing huge bets on AI as well.
""The company's future success depends on two factors: keeping AI development costs low and ensuring that new AI-driven features compel price-sensitive consumers to upgrade their devices,"" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.
Apple started ramping up research and development spending last year, and Cook has said it has spent more than $100 billion on R&D in the past five years.
Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that the company maintains ""very good gross margins"" despite the sometimes burdensome costs associated with building and running AI applications.
Apple splits its AI infrastructure costs between its own data centers and other cloud providers with whom it contracts.
On the regulatory front, Apple faces three probes in the European Union related to the <a href=""/technology/apple-says-its-complying-with-eus-digital-markets-act-amid-criticism-2024-03-18/"">Digital Markets Act</a>, which requires large tech companies to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The bloc's antitrust regulator has accused Apple's App Store of breaching the DMA.
In the United States, the Department of Justice in March <a href=""/legal/us-takes-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-2024-03-21/"">accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market</a> and driving up prices.
Apple's quarterly earnings per share were $1.40, above Wall Street estimates of $1.35, according to LSEG data.
Sales in Apple's services segment, which includes the App Store and represents Apple Music and TV products, rose 14.1% to $24.21 billion, above analyst expectations of $24.01 billion, according to LSEG data.
Mac sales grew 2.5% to $7.01 billion, compared with estimates of $7.02 billion, according to LSEG data.
The company's sales in the iPad segment increased by 23.7% to $7.16 billion, above analyst expectations of $6.61 billion, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years.
In the company's wearables segment, which represents sales of Apple Watches and AirPods headphones, sales fell 2.3% to $8.10 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $7.79 billion, according to LSEG data.
Apple maintained its dividend at 25 cents. In the fiscal second quarter, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback."

Sales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data.
Analysts said the worst may be over for the iPhone.
They expect a <a href=""/technology/apples-ai-push-could-reinvigorate-iphone-sales-customers-look-upgrade-2024-06-11/"">strong upgrade cycle</a> for the iPhone 16 series likely to come in September after Apple said in June it was gearing up to <a href=""/technology/ai-is-sole-focus-apples-annual-conference-2024-06-10/"">introduce AI features</a> across its devices.
Under pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple had in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on select iPhone models. This helped narrow iPhone sales declines in the country to 3.1% in the April-June quarter, according to IDC, from a decline of 6.6% in the first three months of the year.
""The company's fate is turning around in the region,"" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, adding that Apple's AI plans should appeal to customers in the feature-sensitive market.
After lagging rivals Microsoft <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O"" target=""_blank"">(MSFT.O)</a> and Alphabet's <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O"" target=""_blank"">(GOOGL.O)</a> Google in the AI race for months, Cupertino, California-based Apple unveiled plans to bring OpenAI's ChatGPT to its devices and burnish its suite of apps including Siri with new ""Apple Intelligence"" technology.
The commentary helped Apple <a href=""/technology/apple-beats-microsoft-return-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-06-12/"">regain the crown</a> of the world's most valuable company it had lost for a few days to Microsoft. Apple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record.
""Apple's AI strategy announcements were very well received globally and helped improve the declining consumer perception of the brand and generate excitement,"" said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team.
""I won't be surprised if there was a spike in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models in the April-June quarter - that are Apple Intelligence ready,"" Popal added.
Overall, Apple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter.
IPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years.
Mac sales are expected to have ticked up 2.6%, while its wearables and accessories business likely continued its slump with a decline of 6%.
The company's services business - including App Store and subscription services such as Apple TV and Music - likely grew 13.2%.
Growth in the segment has outperformed the company's mainstay hardware business in recent years and the services unit now accounts for more than a quarter of Apple's revenue. However, the outlook for the division has been muddied by regulatory scrutiny.
The European Union's antitrust regulator has accused Apple App Store of <a href=""/technology/apples-app-store-rules-breach-eu-tech-rules-eu-regulators-say-2024-06-24/"">breaching the bloc's Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA), which requires Big Tech to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The company is also facing three investigations under the DMA.
""Apple's services business has been a key part of the bull thesis on the stock. Its growth is particularly important given the very high marginal contribution of the business,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.

Apple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O"" target=""_blank"">(NVDA.O)</a> produces the most sought-after AI processors. Including the chips made by Google, Amazon.com <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O"" target=""_blank"">(AMZN.O)</a> and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.
In the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it uses no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.
Apple could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.
Apple said in the research paper that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips. To build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.
Nvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.
Unlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to the TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.
Apple is <a href=""/technology/ai-is-sole-focus-apples-annual-conference-2024-06-10/"">rolling out portions Apple Intelligence</a> to its beta users this week.
<a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/how-apple-used-googles-help-train-its-ai-models-2024-06-11/"">Reuters reported</a> the use of the TPU chips in June but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.
Google did not return a request for comment, and Nvidia declined to comment.
Apple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.
Apple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software."

Apple's foldable iPhone has progressed from the ideation stage, the report said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.
The company has reached out to suppliers in Asia to make components for the device, the Information reported, adding that iPhone maker has created an internal code name V68 for the product.
Foldable smartphones, powered with artificial intelligence features, are expected to trigger demand for the iPhone maker, which faces stiff competition from Honor and Huawei in China and Samsung globally.
Samsung unveiled its <a href=""/technology/artificial-intelligence/samsung-bolsters-ai-foldable-phones-health-monitoring-smartwatch-ring-2024-07-10/"">latest foldable smartphones</a> earlier in July, making its priciest flagship model lighter and slimmer with new AI functions.

Apple also plans to bring an upgrade to a camera of at least one iPhone model, that would let its users to control the size of the aperture with a mechanical system, possibly allowing users to create depth-of-field effect, the Information report added.

Presenting the annual budget for 2024/25 in parliament on Tuesday, India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said import tax on mobile phones, printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and mobile chargers is in the ""interest of consumers.""
Almost 10-12% of the Apple iPhones are imported each year into India and a 5% reduction in tax on the devices will result in a $35-50 million annual benefit to Apple, said Neil Shah, a co-founder at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research.
Although Apple has boosted its local production in India through contract manufacturers such as Foxconn <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/2317.TW"" target=""_blank"">(2317.TW)</a> and India's Tata Group, it still imports some of its high-end Pro and Pro Max iPhone models into the country.
Apple ""will directly benefit ... they (also) have some models for which PCBAs are still being imported,"" said Shah.
The move will also ""alleviate import duties for new players entering the market. It's a gamechanger for them,"" he added.
Other manufacturers such as Samsung <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/005930.KS"" target=""_blank"">(005930.KS)</a> would also benefit, but to a lesser degree as the majority of their smartphones are locally made, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Apple and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple has a 6% share of India's smartphone market, according to Counterpoint.
India's deputy IT ministry in January <a href=""/technology/india-it-ministry-fears-losing-out-china-vietnam-smartphone-exports-race-2024-02-13/"">privately</a> argued for a reduction on import taxes on mobile phones, saying the country risks losing out to China and Vietnam in the race to become a major smartphone export hub and must ""act fast"" to lure global companies with lower tariffs, Reuters has reported.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and the nation's $24-billion local production scheme covers mobile phones, prompting companies such as Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo to expand local operations.
China's Xiaomi has also in the past <a href=""/technology/xiaomi-says-indias-scrutiny-chinese-firms-unnerves-suppliers-2024-02-11/"">asked</a> for tariff reductions on sub-components used in batteries, USB cables and phone covers."

Streaming platforms have been looking to grow their library of offerings by spending millions on licensing for movies and live sports programming to attract users in a competitive industry.
Apple's successful deal to license around 50 movies from Hollywood studios earlier this year has encouraged it to pursue more content, the report said.
The iPhone maker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Apple TV+ streaming service, known for its original series like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show and Slow Horses, has so far differentiated itself in the streaming landscape with a focus on in-house content, while most rival platforms also offer users older movies and TV shows from other studios.
The strategy has garnered Apple TV+ 72 Emmy Award nominations across various categories.
Apple TV+, however, is among the streaming platforms with the highest number of customers cancelling a subscription, while Netflix has the lowest, according to market research firm Antenna."

If you own an Apple iPhone 12 or later, then you can take advantage of all of the benefits of MagSafe for wireless charging and power transfer. This means you can charge your iPhone wirelessly, but with the power of MagSafe magnets to securely keep your iPhone in place when charging

Additionally, this means you can easily add accessories to your iPhone, like a battery pack to extend your smartphone’s battery life instead of trying to search for a wall outlet for some quick juice. MagSafe is a great feature to have, but much like everything from Apple, you’re going to have to pay a premium price to get your hands on MagSafe chargers and accessories.

In fact, one MagSafe wireless charging puck with a little over three-foot charging cable goes for $39 at Apple’s website . With some of the MagSafe chargers we found on Amazon and Walmart, you can get three perfectly compatible chargers for the price of just one from Apple. What’s more, the chargers we found from brands like Anker and Belkin offer way more charging potential that any of Apple’s proprietary MagSafe chargers, which only come in the flat puck variation described above

Ahead, you’ll find our recommendations for the best MagSafe chargers that are more competitive (either in terms of price or functionality) than anything that’s made by Apple.

Promising review: “Finally moved from a hard connection charging stand to MagSafe charging. My reason was the slowness of other MagSafe devices but this stand with 15W of power is only an hour slower than directly thru the Apple supplied wired charger for overnight charging. Strong hold on the phone with its Torras MagSage case. Maybe a little too strong but that’s better than the other way.” — W. Hohauser

Promising review: “Bought this used and I’m thrilled with it, it will have a permanent place by my bedside as long as I use Apple products. Much more convenient than wrangling multiple MagSafe cords and chargers, with an attractive design and a sturdy weight. My only disappointment is that the AirPods charger on the base is not MagSafe, but given the nature of gravity it doesn’t have to be. The full price is a touch high but you are getting a quality product of good material and design. A very Apple feel, this product is honestly better than most of Apple’s own charging solutions. If you have an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and AirPods, this product will make your life easier and more elegant.” — Paolo Naccari

Promising review: “I decided to set this thing up on my desk for the sake of decluttering my work space. Where it sits on my desk leaves it convenient for charging my phone and out of the way of other screens on my desk. I will say that it can be a bit front heavy when placing your phone on the wireless pad. However when you hook up a couple things to the back of its ports it evens out.

Staying in rural New Zealand is lovely... but when my MacBook locked me out, I was 1,500 miles from the nearest Apple Store. | Credit: Future

Until recently, it was all so clear. I vowed never to spend my money on anything made by Apple. Why? Two reasons.

The first was that I believed Apple kit to be overpriced. Not because they aren't excellent computers, phones or tablets. I've spent many years reviewing them as a journalist, so I know they're good. But essentially because I believe you're paying a signifcant markup for something that's as much a fashion item as a Gucci handbag or a Hermès T-shirt. And that just isn't me.

Advertisement Advertisement

The second, equally powerful dissuader was that I didn't want to buy into Apple's ecosystem. The moment any of my friends had bought an Apple device, it seemed like they'd joined some sort of cult, with all their in-crowd talk of ""Airdrop me this"" and ""iMessage me that"". Plus everything they did seemed to require extra spend, compared with Windows or Android. They couldn't even use a USB phone charger!

So I continued on avoiding Apple, happy in my smug bubble. But every now and again, something would threaten to burst it.

Why I was tempted

Closeup on Dell laptop

There were those lengthy and unwanted Windows updates, which shut down my machine for hours, and usually screwed everything up. There were apps, such as Microsoft Teams, that would refuse point blank to work, despite me using Microsoft's own software to run them. There was the tendency of Windows Media Player to either delete or duplicate songs. At times like this, I'd think about Apple devices and how, as the cliche goes, they ""just work"".

All, this came to a head when my Dell Latitude laptop died, and a salesman in Harvey Norman told me had a 2020 MacBook Air going for a song. Admittedly, this model is now discontinued, but it does feature the much-famed M1 chip: the first of a new era of Apple-made processors that has revolutionised its computing capabilities.

Advertisement Advertisement

It was an offer I couldn't refuse. The low price nullified my first objection, and the issue of the ecosystem… well, I was sure I could learn to live with it.

So I took my shiny new MacBook home, opened it up, and felt I'd made the right decision. It felt fast, smooth, responsive. I loved the screen, and the audio was fantastic. Plus it was super-light. Fabulous.

But then, two days later, my freelancing world came crashing down around me.

How it all went wrong

I typed what I firmly believed to be my password into the opening screen, but it wouldn't accept it. I did it so many times, it locked me out for a few minutes, then 10 minutes, then 20... Panic started to bubble up within me.

Advertisement Advertisement

I used the ""recover password"" option, and Apple said it was sending me a verification email, but none arrived. The same thing happened with the text it said it was sending my phone. I tried other email addresses and phone numbers, and none of them worked either. I tried booting into Recovery Mode but typing the Command + R shortcut got no response. Whatever happened to ""just works""?

I clicked through the Apple help and support pages and got a message saying my only options were (a) to visit an Apple Store, (b) borrow someone else's Apple device or (c) embark on some complex verification over the phone that would take ""up to several days"".

The problem was, I was on my travels and staying in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, New Zealand. I didn't know anyone there, and it was the sort of place where knocking on strangers' door and asking to borrow their iPhone might not go down too well. Plus the nearest Apple Store was 1,529 miles away in Brisbane, Australia. Yes, there are no Apple Stores in New Zealand.

Abstract graphic pattern surrounding Apple logo and the words

As a freelancer, I'm certainly not in a financial position to just take ""several days"" off work. Plus if missed my deadlines, my editors wouldn't be at all happy.

Advertisement Advertisement

It's not like I've never been locked out of a computer or web service before. But normally, recovery is a pretty straightforward process. Yet when I called up Apple's helpline, the (admittedly very helpful and kind) guy on the other end of the phone kept saying things like ""this shouldn't happen…"" and ""hmmm… that should have worked"", which only increased my panic.

All of which made me think about how Apple has made their devices so secure that even the FBI can't break into them. Indeed, nor could Apple itself when the Feds have asked them to help. Which is great to know if someone has stolen your device; but not so great when you're locked out yourself. Why, I screamed at myself inwardly, did I ever choose Apple?

Back for good?

Thankfully, after about two and half hours on the phone with support staff, I managed to get back into my laptop. My brain was so scrambled by this point, I couldn't even tell you what fixed it. All I can tell you is the people I spoke to went above and beyond to fix my problem, and never stopped being polite, friendly and positive. Top marks.

And two weeks later, I've had no issues to date. On balance, I love my MacBook Air and am still glad I bought it. And if you can afford one of the best MacBooks released in the last few years, I'd say go for it.

Just be aware that Apple's security procedures are very tight and, in my experience, more of a hindrance than a help. So even if it goes everything you've been taught, make a physical note of the password you set up with, put it in a safe place, and be very, very careful about typing it in."

If you’ve opened up an Apple Watch for the first time this Christmas, then you might be wondering where to start. While you can do a range of things on all of the best Apple Watch models, from tracking workouts and making payments to turn-by-turn navigation and voice calling, having even a few great apps can make your Apple Watch a do-it-all wearable companion you’ll wonder how you ever lived without.

Like the iPhone, the Apple Watch relies on an ecosystem of third-party apps to expand its user experience, and downloading some out the gate can really make a difference.

I’ve been using and writing about the Apple Watch for nearly 10 years, really since it first debuted. With that in mind, I’ve pulled five of my top picks for apps you should download right away on your Apple Watch.

Three Apple Watches on a blue background showing the SmartGym app

The Apple Watch boasts a wealth of fitness tracking and health features built-in. But what if you could track and follow personalized workouts directly from your wrist, even if you don’t have your iPhone nearby? SmartGym is a standalone watch app that uses AI to create personalized workouts for you, even suggesting changes as you go. It supports gym workouts, home workouts, and even High Intensity Interval Training. There's a reason it’s featured in Apple’s own Watch adverts. This app is free to download and has a small monthly subscription for more workouts.

Download SmartGym for Apple Watch

Runna app being used on track

I used Runna to kickstart my return to running in 2024 and was really impressed. Runna is an easy-to-use running coach with a great standalone watch app. Without your iPhone, you can get tailor-made running workouts on your wrist, including spoken instructions that give you pace, intervals, and time updates through your headphones. A quick glance at the wrist will show live pace updates, timings, and more. If you want to use your Apple Watch to get running in 2025, definitely give Runna a bash.

Citymapper app on apple watch

While you can use Apple Maps and even turn-by-turn navigation on your Apple Watch, Citymapper takes navigation on your wrist to the next level. This app can help you find the best way to traverse over 400 cities by bus, train, walking, tram, subway, or any combination of transport modes. It offers step-by-step directions and instructions, with features to save destinations like Home or Work. It’ll even give you the frequency of buses and trains, and alert you when your stop is coming up.

CARROT Weather on Apple Watch

Award-winning app, CARROT Weather brings personality to weather forecasting. It has five personalities including a “profanity-laden” overkill setting, delivering a weather robot that will literally swear at you while telling you the weather. It gathers weather data from various sources including Apple Weather, AccuWeather, and Tommorow.io, and includes alerts for rain, lighting, and more. You can customize the interface and there’s even an Apple Watch complication. It’s a big step up from the basic Apple Weather app.

The CheatSheet app on Apple Watch

Cheatsheet is a cheat code when it comes to the Apple Watch and might be one of my all-time favorite life hacks. Cheatsheet is a tiny widget app that lets you store important information on your Apple Watch for easy access. Maybe you need the Wi-Fi password handy for visitors, or the combination to a locked door, or the coordinates to your safe hou… Okay, maybe not, but you get the idea. Cheatsheet is an easy way to store important information you’d otherwise forget, viewable as a list or in a complication on your Apple Watch face, replete with more than 200 custom icons for visual cues.

Kickstart your Apple Watch

So there you have it, five top apps to give your Apple Watch a much-needed boost right out of the gate. Even if just one of these apps ends up a mainstay on your wrist, you’ll definitely appreciate the benefits they offer. Be sure to visit Apple’s App Store to continue discovering handy apps for Apple Watch. You might even find that apps you’re already using have dedicated Apple Watch versions you didn’t even know existed!"

Instead, backing up your device to iCloud now requires iOS 9 or later.

Apple announced this change ahead of time and implemented it on Wednesday, December 18, 2024. As a result, backups created on devices running iOS 8 and earlier are no longer available because Apple deleted them as part of this change. Don’t worry; any app data, settings, and files you’ve manually uploaded to iCloud remain intact.

Old devices running iOS 8, such as iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the fifth-generation iPod touch and earlier, still work as usual, but they can no longer back up to and restore from iCloud unless updated to iOS 9 or later. If your device doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for iOS 9, you can still manually back it up to a Mac using the Finder or a Windows PC using iTunes or the Apple Devices app.

“On December 18, 2024, device backups will require iOS 9 or later,” reads Apple’s email informing iPhone and iPad owners about the upcoming change. “Apps and data stored on your devices will not be affected, and you will still be able to manually back up devices to a Mac or Windows PC.”

With the change now in effect, you can no longerr create new backups for iPhones and iPads powered by iOS 5 through iOS 8, and any existing backups of these devices are no longer available. If your device supports iOS 9, you can install the update by going to Settings > General > Software Update and following the instructions. You can also install the latest software for your device using the Finder on your Mac or the iTunes or Apple Devices apps on Windows.

It’s worth pointing out that iCloud automatically deletes unused device backups. “If you turn off iCloud Backup for a device, any backups stored in iCloud are kept for 180 days before being deleted,” according to the iPhone User Manual. Apple clarified it removed support for iCloud Backup on older devices “to more closely align with our published minimum software requirements” for iCloud (a support page on Apple’s website details the minimum iCloud system requirements by feature).

This comes down to CloudKit, Apple’s software framework that acts as a backend as a service. Apps can use CloudKit to store data in iCloud and keep everything synced across devices and on the web. Apple has now stopped using the older iCloud Backup system because it was less secure and reliable, and transitioned the feature to CloudKit.

Apple developing ""Baltra"" server chip for AI, targeting 2026 production

Israeli silicon team leading project; Mac chip canceled for focus

Broadcom collaboration and TSMC’s N3P tech to enhance development

Apple is reportedly developing its first server chip tailored specifically for artificial intelligence.

A paywalled report by Wayne Ma and Qianer Liu in The Information claims the project, codenamed “Baltra,” aims to address the growing computational demands of AI-driven features and is expected to enter mass production by 2026.

Apple’s silicon design team in Israel, which was responsible for designing the processors that replaced Intel chips in Macs in 2020, is now leading the development of the AI processor, according to sources. To support this effort, Apple has reportedly canceled the development of a high-performance Mac chip made up of four smaller chips stitched together.

Central to Apple’s efforts

The report notes this decision, made over the summer, is intended to free up engineers in Israel to focus on Baltra, signaling Apple’s shift in priorities toward AI hardware.

Apple is working with semiconductor giant Broadcom on this project, using the company’s advanced networking technologies needed for AI processing. While Apple usually designs its chips in-house, Broadcom’s role is expected to focus on networking solutions, marking a new direction in their partnership.

To make the AI chip, The Information says Apple plans to use TSMC’s advanced N3P process, an upgrade from the technology behind its latest processors, like the M4. This move highlights Apple’s focus on enhancing performance and efficiency in its chip designs.

The Baltra chip is expected to drive Apple’s efforts to integrate AI more deeply into its ecosystem. By leveraging Broadcom’s networking expertise and TSMC's advanced manufacturing techniques, Apple appears determined to catch up to rivals in the AI space and establish a stronger presence in the industry.

In November 2024, we reported that Apple approached its long-time manufacturing partner Foxconn to build AI servers in Taiwan. These servers, using Apple’s M-series chips, are intended to support Apple Intelligence features in iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks."

The Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using conflict minerals.

Acting on behalf of the Congolese government, lawyers have argued that Apple is complicit in crimes committed by armed groups that control some of the mines in the east of DR Congo.

In its 2023 review of the issue, Apple said it monitors its supply chain and works to mitigate risks as well as improving measures to trace the source of minerals.

The authorities in France and Belgium will now look at whether there is enough evidence to take the legal action further.

In a statement, the lawyers for the DR Congo talked about Apple's supply chain being contaminated with ""blood minerals"".

They allege that the tin, tantalum and tungsten is taken from conflict areas and then ""laundered through international supply chains"".

""These activities have fuelled a cycle of violence and conflict by financing militias and terrorist groups and have contributed to forced child labour and environmental devastation.""

Apple has not responded to a BBC request for comment, but in its report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission detailing its actions on this issue in 2023, the company highlights the measures it has taken to ensure that it is not using conflict minerals.

""Although Apple does not directly purchase, procure, or source primary minerals, we are committed to meeting and exceeding internationally accepted due diligence standards for primary minerals and recycled materials in our supply chain,"" it said.

As a result, all those involved in the supply chain have to participate in an ""independent third-party conflict minerals audit"". Apple said that in 2023 it removed 14 ""smelters and refiners"" that would not participate or did not meet the requirements for responsible sourcing.

The east of DR Congo is a major source of minerals and the global thirst for them has fuelled wars there for decades.

Rights groups have long alleged that large quantities of minerals from legitimate mines, as well as from facilities run by armed groups, are transported to neighbouring Rwanda and end up in our phones and computers.

Rwanda has in the past described the Congolese government's legal action against Apple as a media stunt.

It has denied selling any conflict minerals to the tech company.

Quick summary

Apple is reportedly preparing two foldable devices: a folding iPhone larger than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and a 19-inch folding MacBook.

The latter would be biggest MacBook we've seen to date.

Apple is claimed to be making some major changes to the iPhone and iPad, and a new report gives us a really good indication of what those changes will be.

Advertisement Advertisement

In addition to radically redesigning the iPhone in the form of the iPhone 17 Air, Apple reportedly intends to make its biggest MacBook ever – a laptop that's different from any MacBook you've seen before.

That's because it's could be a foldable device.

The Wall Street Journal (paywall) says that Apple is working on three key new devices: the iPhone 17 Air, a folding iPhone, and a folding MacBook with a 19-inch display.

When will Apple launch its foldables?

According to the source, the folding iPhone is currently scheduled for a 2026 or 2027 release, with the innovative MacBook following along later.

The larger foldable is allegedly ""intended to serve as a laptop"" and ""would have a screen that unfolds to be nearly as large as some desktop monitors, at about 19 inches"". The folding iPhone would be smaller, of course, but still big when unfolded. Its display would be ""larger than an iPhone 16 Pro Max"", it is said.

Apple has been relatively slow to enter the foldables market, and the report says that one reason is that current foldable phones on the market don't meet Apple's requirements for thinness, lightness or energy efficiency.

Apple has also reportedly encountered issues around the hinge and the cover that protects the folding display.

Those challenges haven't been completely solved, so while some executives really want a 2026 release for the folding iPhone, it may take longer to meet Apple's demanding specification.

That means that the iPhone star of the show in 2025 is likely to be the iPhone 17 Air, which we're expecting to launch alongside the other iPhone 17 models in September. That's going to be sold primarily on its lack of porkiness.

Apple is also apparently gambling that its reduced feature set – most likely including a lesser camera system than the one in the other iPhones – won't be a deal-breaker for style-conscious purchasers."

iOS.12 Photos app updates

When Apple rolled out iOS 18 this past fall, it significantly changed the iPhone’s Photos app — and many people didn’t like it. The update gave the app a new look and organizing features, but it also added clutter and made it more complicated to scroll through your photos.

The good news is that Apple appears to have taken that feedback on the chin. Thanks to iOS 18.2 (available now), the Photos app has received a significant update again — only this time, Apple a lot of the maligned features and added some new things as well.

Here’s what you need to know.

Videos take up the entire screen (again)

One of the annoying things that iOS 18 brought to the Photos app had to do with videos — when you played a video, it had borders and didn’t take up the entire screen by default. They also had a weird zoomed-in effect. You had to tap your iPhone’s screen to get rid of the borders and play your video at full-screen.

Thankfully, iOS 18.2 fixed that. When you play videos, they are now full-screen by default.

Swipe navigation is back

iOS 18.2 brings a simple quality-of-life update to using the Photos app, too. With iOS 18, you had to tap a back button (located in the top corner) to go “back” when scrolling through photos in Collections.

Now with iOS 18.2, you can simply swipe right to go back … just like how you would on pretty much any other app.

Stop videos from auto-looping

Another thing with videos. When you played a video in the Photos app on iOS 18, it would automatically start playing again when it ended. It auto-looped, which you may have found annoying.

With iOS 18.2, videos still auto-loop by default — but you can turn it off. Simply open the Photos app, tap your profile (your face in the top-right corner) and toggle off “Loop Videos.” You can also do this through the Settings app and selecting the Photos app.

More precise video scrubbing

Video scrubbing — when you use the slider to reach a precise spot in a video — gets a small but useful update.

Specifically, iOS 18.2 delivers support for frame-by-frame video scrubbing with a timestamp with a millisecond reading (as opposed to just the second reading). This helps you be even more precise when getting to the exact spot of a video.

Clear your browsing history

For the first time, iOS 18.2 lets you delete your browsing history when browsing the Recently Viewed and Recently Shared albums. This way, you don’t have to see the same photos again. And it’s super easy.

When browsing Recently Viewed or Recently Shared albums, simply tap the More (…) button in the top-right corner and selecg “Remove All from Recently Viewed.”"

Quick Summary

Apple has released the tvOS 18.2 software update which adds a few new tricks to Apple TV, including aspect ratio options.

The software update also brings the Snoopy screensaver to Apple TV – a feature that was also revealed at WWDC in June.

It's been a big week for Apple devices this week after the company released its latest software updates with new features for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.

Apple Intelligence is now readily available on iPhone, iPad and Mac, for example, adding some of the more interesting features too, like Image Playground, Genmoji and ChatGPT integration. However, let's not forget about Apple TV – that also gets some new tricks thanks to the tvOS 18.2 software release.

I won't lie, my favourite new feature for Apple TV with tvOS 18.2 is actually the Snoopy screensaver, which was announced at WWDC in June but has only just arrived. That's not what we are talking about here though.

Perhaps more important to some are the new aspect ratio options. We have written about these before as they were available in the public beta of tvOS 18.2, but now they can be selected by anyone who has updated their Apple TV.

You can now choose between Automatic, 16:9, 21:9, 2.37:1. 2.39:1, 2.40:1. DCI 4K and 32:9. Most TVs are 16:9, but if you happen to have a projector connected to your Apple TV, you can choose the aspect ratio that is best suited to your screen.

How to change the aspect ratio on Apple TV

The aspect ratio options can be found in the Audio and Video settings within your Apple TV settings.

You will need to ensure you are running tvOS 18.2, which you will be able to check in the settings menu on your Apple TV, too. If you aren't, you can push the software update through manually and enjoy not only the different aspect ratio options, but Snoopy too."

This allows people to layer another track on top of a pre-existing track, which turns the app into an extremely-limited, though still useful, recording tool. This update is part of iOS 18.2, which also brings more AI tomfoolery like a custom emoji maker.

There’s one major caveat here. The Voice Memos software tweak is only available for the iPhone 16 Pro and the Pro Max. This is a bummer, given that track layering isn’t exactly rocket science, but the company says there’s a good reason to exclude other models.

The software lets people add that second layer without wearing headphones, which is possible thanks to some algorithmic wizardry, the A18 Pro chip and those new “studio-quality” microphones that come with the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. That’s a pretty neat trick but, you know, not exactly necessary. I don’t mind wearing headphones for a minute.

The update can also split the voice memo into its two composite tracks, for use later with legitimate recording software. That’s another neat little trick and sort of similar to what The Beatles did for their latest (and final) song. Singer Michael Bublé and country star Carly Pearce used the Voice Memos app to make a little Christmas song, as seen below.

As with all things recorded with Voice Memos, the files will be synced across devices thanks to Apple iCloud. These multi-layered tracks will also be available on Mac computers to drag-and-drop into a session with Logic Pro."

Apple today (December 11) announced the winners of the App Store Awards 2024, continuing the annual tradition of recognizing excellent apps compatible with the company's devices. The NYT Games app, largely credited with the Wordle and Connections phenomena, is recognized among 17 total honorees in this year's awards.

The App Store Awards aim to showcase entertainment, value, and relevance to Apple's users. A majority of the apps are device-specific, including two new categories for Apple Vision Pro, while others recognize those apps that have made some kind of cultural impact, such as NYT Games.

Some readers might know Tom's Guide for our daily dedication to Wordle tips and Connections clues. Me? I've been doing the NYT Crossword and comparing results with my family members for years, so I was particularly excited to see the app among this year's App Store Awards winners.

""This year we've added two additional games to our portfolio, plus archives, so this has been the year of our app really shining and a lot of investment has gone into it,"" Ashby Thornwell, NYT Games senior engineering manager, told me. ""Having a daily fresh puzzle every day keeps players engaged.""

Apple App Store Award 2024 winners

The NYT Games app is one of 17 total winners among this year's App Store Awards, spanning apps for iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro.

Another standout to me is Kino, the iPhone App of the Year, that pairs the iPhone 16 Pro's video-capturing abilities with a number of cinematic color-grading presets. I also am impressed by the ways Adobe Lightroom continues to innovate for photo editing as the Mac App of the Year.

Apple sets aside winners in gaming categories as well. From the best Apple Arcade game to the best iPad games, users might find themselves inspired to check out some new titles based on the 2024 App Store Awards.

Otherwise, the cultural impact category celebrates apps that positioned for lasting significance among communities. Considering how many people have made NYT Games part of their daily family communication, the award makes sense. That said, apps like Oko and EF Hello that make it easier to exist in global settings are well-deserving, too.

The iOS 18.2 rollout is underway as Apple finally brings the second wave of Apple Intelligence features to compatible iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. This includes several major new integrations, like the seriously impressive Visual Intelligence tool.

It's also a significant update for iPhone users in the U.K., Australia and a few other countries outside the U.S. who will now be able to access the AI features without needing to set their devices to US English.

Apple Intelligence is undoubtedly the headline act but as a reminder, it's only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and the iPhone 16 series of phones. For the record, here's why it's worth upgrading your iPhone to get access.

But that doesn't mean iOS 18.2 isn't a bumper upgrade for all Apple users — noteworthy non-AI features include an update to Find My that lets you share AirTag locations with trusted friends or the option to view fullscreen videos in the redesigned Photos app.

The nature of software rollouts mean they won't hit everyone all at once, but we're following along with the update process live — as well as calling out some of our favorite features below — so you can stay updated with the latest changes you're getting on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.

Top New Apple Intelligence Features

Apple Intelligence is Apple's tightly integrated suite of AI solutions that will touch almost all areas of your iPhone. Here are some of the best new features you're going to want to try out as soon as you've updated.

Image Playground: Apple’s new AI image generator that lets you turn a description or person into an image with fun style options.

Genmoji: Genmoji lets you create your own emoji using the keyboard. Can also be shared as Stockers or Tapbacks.

Writing Tools Describe your change. New feature lets you describe a specific change you want to make to your text, such as adding more dynamic action words to a resume.

Visual intelligence: Helps users instantly learn about objects and places instantly, thanks to the new Camera Control on the iPhone 16 series. Think of it as Google Lens on steroids.

ChatGPT integration: Siri can tap into ChatGPT with your permission to answer questions and requests. And users can ask ChatGPT to help compose original content in Writing Tools as well as generate images.

Image Wand: Transforms a rough sketch into a polished image that complements a user’s notes. Works with Apple Pencil on iPad.

Live updates

How to install iOS 18.2

Software Update menu on iPhone showing iOS 18.2 ready to download

The first thing you’re going to want to know is how do you actually get the iOS 18.2 update on your iPhone? Luckily, the process couldn’t be simpler. The most efficient way to make sure you’re in line to get it is to turn on automatic updates in your iPhone’s Setting menu. Simply go to Settings > General > Software Update on a compatible device.

If you want a full step-by-step breakdown, we’ve got you covered. Just follow our how-to guide here which includes screenshots walking you through the process.

Genmoji: A personal way to communicate

Genmoji in iOS 18

Genmoji is a brilliant addition to the Apple ecosystem. It uses AI image generation technology for the specific purpose of letting users craft their own custom emojis. You can then send them in a chat as an emoji reaction, sticker or tapback.

There are now hundreds of different emojis available through the emoji keyboard, but with Genmoji you don’t need to find one, or even a combination, that fit your requirements — you can just make exactly what you want. For example, craft a slice of pizza with bananas on top or an emoji version of yourself playing guitar.

Available on any device capable of running Apple Intelligence, the genmoji is generated entirely ‘on device’, meaning no information is sent out to the cloud. Your phone, laptop or iPad does all the hard work which also makes it much faster and accessible.

There are limitations though as Apple has implemented guardrails preventing the creation of potentially harmful genmojis. Basically, if it wouldn’t be available on a normal emoji keyboard then you probably can’t generate it using Genmoji.

Visual Intelligence is Apple's answer to Google Lens

How to use Visual Intelligence.

Visual intelligence is one of the most exciting features of Apple Intelligence coming through with iOS 18.2. It’s Apple’s answer to the likes of Google Lens and is only available on the iPhone 16 series where it can be accessed directly from the Camera Control button.

All you have to do is point your camera at something you want to learn about and click the shutter. You’ll know Apple Intelligence is working because you’ll see a rainbow-colored flash.

Once you have the image captured, Visual Intelligence will tell you things like opening hours for a shop, reviews for a cafe or even what a sign in a foreign language says. While you can typically do this with an old fashioned image search, the seamless interaction of Visual Intelligence with your iPhone’s camera will hugely speed up this process.

Finally, if you snap a picture of something with a lot of text in it, Visual Intelligence can generate a quick summary for you to help save time.

Who is getting Apple Intelligence and when?

Apple Intelligence on white background

Apple Intelligence is a pretty seismic shift in how you use your iPhone but, crucially, not everyone is going to get it with iOS 18.2. There are both device and region limitations to be aware of.

Cupertino's suite of AI enhancements will be available on the following devices: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, any iPad with A17 Pro or M1 and later, and any Mac with an M1 chip and later.

Advertisement Advertisement

When we're talking about iPad and Mac, those enhancements come with iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 which are also rolling out today.

There's a caveat in place for anyone reading this in the EU — while Apple Intelligence will roll out for the Mac in that region, it won't become available on iPhone or iPad for several months yet. Apple says it will be giving EU iPhone and iPad users access to Writing Tools, Genmoji, a redesigned Siri with richer language understanding, ChatGPT integration, and more from April 2025.

For anyone reading this outside of an English-speaking country, Apple Intelligence can be accessed in most regions around the world when the device and Siri language are set to localized English for the following regions: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., or the U.S.

Image Playground: Apple’s new AI image generator

Image Playground in iOS 18.2

Image Playground does something special that only Apple can do at this scale. It is fine-tuning an AI image model on your own pictures. This is known as personal context and its possible because it happens entirely on-device.

Advertisement Advertisement

Your phone, tablet or laptop are doing all the hard work in analyzing your images, describing you and your family and then creating something new based on that detail.

It is an incredibly fun way to create personalized stickers to send in the group chat, build your own custom memes and otherwise generate images with a personal touch.

Available as a standalone app or from within Messages, Image Playground pictures come in two styles: Cartoon and Illustration. There's no photorealism, in part because that would over-tax the capabilities of a phone, but also because it allows Apple to reduce the potential for misuse.

It is one of those Apple Apps that you don’t really ""get"" until you try it, and once you’ve tried it it’ll likely become one of your favorites.

The reviews are in...

Apple Intelligence type to Siri in iOS 18.1

We've covered Apple Intelligence a fair bit on Tom's Guide, but we're not the only ones excited by the potential of this new technology. Over at the Wall Street Journal, Joanna Stern has given her thoughts in an in-depth Apple Intelligence review with the title ""The AI Apple Promised Us"".

Advertisement Advertisement

You can read it for yourself here but Stern's take is similar to my own feeling on Apple Intelligence: it makes the iPhone 16 what was promised to us back in September.

What's interesting is that the WSJ isn't convinced a software update alone is enough to get people to upgrade their device. I'm not sure I agree. We know that users are holding onto their phones for longer and with seemingly ever-more-incremental hardware upgrades happening, the big draw to update your iPhone in future could well depend on large scale software improvements like Apple Intelligence.

Apple Intelligence in more languages

To use Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, you had to have your device set to U.S. English. That's fine but not ideal if you speak a different flavor (or flavour if you prefer) of English, and could be tricky if English is not your native language.

Fortunately, among its upgrade iOS 18.2 allows devices using Australian, Canadian, Irish, New Zealand, South African and U.K. English to work with Apple Intelligence. Sadly beyond that, other languages are still only due to arrive between now and April 2025.

If you want to switch languages to take advantage of Apple Intelligence, you can use this guide.

ChatGPT comes to iPhone

iOS 18.2 ChatGPT integration

Perhaps one of the biggest talking points in iOS 18.2 that I'm most excited for is the fact that ChatGPT itself will now be integrated with your iPhone.

It needs to be enabled manually, but with the feature switched on, ChatGPT will be able to take care of things that Siri can't alone, like generating text with Writing Tools. You can also log-in with your own account if you wish so you can access your ChatGPT Plus subscription if you have one.

ChatGPT also helps with Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16. The ""Ask"" function directs your requests through the chatbot to hopefully teach you more about what's in front of you.

Supercharged Siri

iPhone 16 Pro Max Siri

Siri tends to take something of a beating when we talk about which virtual assistant is the best, but you're going to notice several changes once you've updated to iOS 18.2 that make it far more helpful.

Advertisement Advertisement

For starters, Siri is now able to talk with a more conversational tone, and is better at understanding what you’re asking. Better still it can remember what you’ve asked before, and continue conversations regardless of how many other requests you make in the interim.

Oh, and those requests can be made by typing, rather than forcing you to use your voice. If you want to get the best from Siri after you've installed your update, try these seven prompts first.

Apple Intelligence on iOS 18.2 will make writing easier

Apple Intelligence Writing Tools

Today's update will also introduce Apple’s Writing Tools, a suite of AI-driven features that enhance writing and communication. These tools offer functionalities such as grammar and spelling checks, tone adjustments, and sentence rewrites, directly integrated into Apple's ecosystem.

This development positions Apple Intelligence as a direct competitor to established services like Grammarly. Yet, with Apple Intelligence, users don't have to add any external writing tool apps because everything they need works seamlessly across Apple products.

Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.2 will provide comprehensive grammar correction, stylistic refinement, and tone adjustments regardless across multiple platforms. Open a Google Doc or email on your phone and start writing with the assistance of Apple AI. This is going to be very useful.

How to use Image Playground

The interface in Image Playground for generating images with text prompts

Philip Michaels here. I'm the managing editor for mobile at Tom's Guide, and I'll be taking over for Jeff Parsons the rest of the way. And now that we've talked about what features are available via the iOS 18.2 update, let's talk about how to use them.

Let's start with Image Playground, which is probably the feature people are most excited about. We've got a step-by-step guide on how to use Image Playground, but the TLDR; version is that you'll launch the app and be immediately greeted by a text field where you can enter in the image you want to see. There's also some suggestions on various objects, themes and backgrounds to use in your generated image if you need help coming up with a prompt or fine-tuning your creation.

My advice to you after using the app is to make a lot of adjustments to your image, either by adding more to your prompt or removing the parts of the prompt that don't quite work.

During the iOS 18.2 beta, you had to first sign up with Apple to use Image Playground, and you could only get started with the app once you were approved. In my experience, that took a couple of days. I don't know if that will continue now that iOS 18.2 is out of beta, but it's something to bear in mind when firing up Image Playground for the first time.

Using ChatGPT in iOS 18.2

ChatGPT Siri on iPhone iOS 18.2

The arrival of ChatGPT on your iPhone is a pretty big deal, so you're going to want to get started with it right away. Here's our guide on how to use ChatGPT in iOS 18.2, including pointers on to set it up and how it integrates with features like Siri and Visual Intelligence.

How to use Visual Intelligence

Apple Intelligence features don't work on every iPhone that can run iOS 18, as you probably know. But there's at least one Apple Intelligence feature that won't work on every iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence.

We're talking about Visual Intelligence, Apple's answer to Google Lens, which is limited to the four new iPhone 16 models. But if you happen to be an iPhone 16 owner upgrading to iOS 18.2, you'll want to read our step-by-step guide on how to use Visual Intelligence with your new iPhone.

An iOS 18 overview

Apple Intelligence on an iPhone screen

We're focusing on Apple Intelligence here for obvious reasons, but sometimes it helps to take a step back and look at the entire iOS 18 update to grasp just how many changes Apple has made. Our iOS 18 hub is now updated to reflect the new features introduced by iOS 18.2 — you might find it a handy reference for all the big changes that have come to your iPhone in the last few months.

How to use Genmoji

apple wwdc 2024 keynote genmoji section

As someone who doesn't really use the emoji that already exist, I'm pretty sure that Genmoji — Apple's generative imaging feature to create custom emoji through text prompts — is not going to be something I turn to in iOS 18.2. But plenty of the rest of you seem to be emoji-crazy, so Genmoji is probably going to be one of the first things you try.

If so, you'll want to read our guide on how to use Genmoji, which walks you through the process of creating your very own emoji for just the right situation.

Assessing Image Playground

An Image Playground generated image of a man dressed as a pilgrim on an iPhone 15 Pro screen

I had the chance to test Image Playground as part of the iOS 18.2 beta. My verdict: while the images the app creates are certainly fun, the tool feels very limited at the moment. There are just two styles at the moment — animation and illustration — and that inevitably means your output starts looking the same the more you use Image Playground.

I also wish you could do more with images once you've generated them. Right now, your output seems to be limited to ones that you can share in Messages or paste into a Note, but that's about it.

Your mileage may vary, of course, so we'd love to hear about what you wind up using Image Playground to create.

More than just Apple Intelligence

iOS 18.2 photos clear recently viewed photos and arrange albums alphabetically

Apple Intelligence is the focus of iOS 18.2, but it's not the only source of changes in this software update. Among the changes available to all iPhones that run iOS 18 are some tweaks to the Photos app, which should make it easier to customize the look of things.

With iOS 18.2, you can now sort albums alphabetically. You're also able to clear the history in the Recently Viewed and Recently Shared albums. Additional improvements include the ability to scrub frame-by-frame when you're viewing videos and to turn off auto-looping video in the Settings app.

Revisiting my iOS 18 review

iOS 18 public beta

Whenever there's an update to Apple's iPhone software as hefty as iOS 18.2 is, I typically go and update my review of the operating system. That's why I've just finished the update to my iOS 18 review, accounting for the new Apple Intelligence features and some of the other changes Apple has made with this update.

My assessment hasn't changed that much since iOS 18.1 — the Apple Intelligence additions are significant steps in Apple's move to include more AI-powered capabilities in its devices, though it remains a work in progress. Some tools are quite useful — summaries for example — while others need a bit more polish. (I refer you to my Image Playground criticism from earlier.) The biggest step forward will be a more context-aware Siri, but I don't imagine that's going to be complete until next year.

Experimenting with Visual Intelligence

Some AI features can feel like gimmicks, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Visual Intelligence, where you can use both the camera on your iPhone and AI to look up information. Here's a look at one of the practical uses of that capability — using Visual Intelligence to count calories in the food you eat.

More on ChatGPT and iOS 18.2

OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, is understandably excited about the integration of its AI model with iOS 18.2. That was the focus of today's installment of OpenAI's 12 days of announcements. And we've got a look at what OpenAI had to say about ChatGPT and Siri."

The New Year is fast approaching, and if you're anything like me, January always brings a host of New Year's resolutions, many of which have something to do with health or fitness. If that sentiment rings a bell, you might be interested in investing in something like the Apple Watch Series 9 to help conquer your fitness goals. The Apple Watch is built with advanced health sensors to provide deep insights into your mental and physical health, plus it offers a ton of ways to stay active with the Workout app.

While the Apple Watch Series 9 usually rings in at close to $600, Amazon Canada shoppers can score it on major sale right now. For a limited time, shoppers can save $150 on the smartwatch, plus shop even more Apple devices like AirPods, iPads and AirTags on sale — many with even lower price tags than they had on Black Friday.

One happy shopper calls the smartwatch the ""best thing"" they have purchased for ""health monitoring.""

""I wasn't very crazy about hi-tech products,"" they write, assuming an Apple Watch was akin to a ""super expensive toy."" However, it's the ""best thing,"" they say.

The Apple Watch Series 9 is ""amazing,"" echoes another shopper. It's a ""must-buy for Apple users.""

It's an absolute ""gem,"" writes a third shopper.

While the bulk of reviews are positive, some note the strap was ""too short"" for their wrist, something to keep in mind when placing your order.

Apple made good on a modest first wave of features in October. But iOS 18.2 — along with sibling OS upgrades for Mac and iPad — will bring a meatier set of Apple Intelligence features to Apple's suite of devices, including Genmoji, Image Playground and ChatGPT integration.

To check out Apple's new AI, you must have an eligible device and run the current iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 or MacOS 15.1. (On the iPhone side, that's basically the current iPhone 16 models plus last year's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.) You'll also need to join the waitlist in the Settings app, but Apple Support says it usually only takes a few hours to gain access. Once approved, you'll receive a notification saying it's ready to activate on your device.

Here's what Apple Intelligence features you'll soon have access to this month and beyond. For now, you can test out Writing Tools, check out the new additions to the Photos app, see summarized notifications and more.

Which Apple Intelligence features are coming soon?

More Apple intelligence features are expected to become available in December with the release of iOS 18.2, but you can try them now if you're running the developer beta. Here's what Apple has said is coming.

Advertisement Advertisement

Genmoji: You'll be able to create custom emojis called Genmoji by using photos of friends and family or by typing a description of what you want.

Image Playground: This tool will let you quickly create fun images, like turning yourself into a cartoon character, and let you come up with a new image based on the description you give.

ChatGPT integration: Perhaps the most well-known AI tool will be built-in to Writing Tools and Siri to help out with requests. For instance, if you ask Siri about a certain document, ChatGPT can help. But Apple is, as usual, prioritizing privacy considerations: You'll always be asked before your information is shared and you'll control when it's used.

Priority Notifications: When you receive multiple notifications each day, they'll be prioritized by what’s most important. For instance, if you have a dinner reservation that evening or an important meeting to attend, those notifications will be shown at the top of your notifications so you don't forget.

Visual intelligence (iPhone 16 series only): Using the new Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 lineup, you'll be able to learn about and interact with objects and places right in front of you. For instance, you can use it to translate a sign from one language to another or find out more about a restaurant you've never been to by opening the Camera app, then pressing and holding the Camera Control button.

In 2025, we'll see a more robust Siri integration. For starters, it's getting onscreen awareness to ""take action with things on your screen."" So if a friend texts you their new email address or when their birthday is, you can ask Siri to add it to their contact card.

Priority notifications are coming soon to iPhones compatible with Apple Intelligence. (Apple)

What is Apple Intelligence?

Apple Intelligence is essentially Apple's very own generative AI system built-in to eligible devices to help with tasks like writing, communicating and expressing yourself. Apple says that while it draws on your personal context, it doesn't allow anyone else – Apple employees included – to access your personal data.

Note that Apple will integrate ChatGPT into its system to help with Siri and Writing Tools (more below), but you must give permission to use it on a case-by-case basis.

Which Apple Intelligence features are available now?

Apple Intelligence provides access to a variety of new features you can use on your iPhone, iPad or Mac if they're one of the eligible devices.

New Photos app additions: While a new Photos app is available for everyone who upgraded to iOS 18, iPhones compatible with Apple Intelligence (and running iOS 18.1 or newer) also get a new Clean Up tool that lets you remove background objects from your pictures with just a tap. For instance, you can remove strangers from your family photo at the beach or that piece of laundry you forgot to put away. And if you have thousands of photos and videos saved, you can now find what you're looking for by describing it — show all photos featuring a blue house with a red door, for example.

Writing Tools: You can use this in most apps to help proofread your text, as well as craft different versions of what you've written until you find the right words. For example, if you need to write a cover letter or send an email to your boss, you can use Writing Tools to help you communicate what you need to say. This tool will also summarize an entire lecture for you, or any text you select. More features will be added in future updates.

Summarized notifications: If you receive dozens of notifications each day, you'll now see a summary of the messages to make it easier to read through them.

Siri improvements: Apple has given Siri an AI makeover to make conversations with the smart assistant more natural, but more. And for your convenience, you'll be able to switch back and forth between giving commands by voice or by typing to Siri. The bot also comes with ""richer language-understanding capabilities,"" which is helpful if you tend to jump from thought to thought while talking.

Siri improvements: Apple is pledging to make Siri more dynamic and useful with a series of upgrades coming in 2025. In the meantime, you can now switch back and forth between giving commands by voice or by typing. The assistant is also now said to offer ""richer language-understanding capabilities,"" which is helpful if you tend to jump from thought to thought while talking. And it now features a new interface, which shows a glowing edge on your screen when activated.

Which devices are compatible with Apple Intelligence?

Compatibility with Apple Intelligence is largely limited to very recent iPhones, as well as Macs and iPads with Apple's M-series Apple Silicon chips. Here's the full list of devices that will work with Apple Intelligence.

iPhone 16

iPhone 16 Plus

iPhone 16 Pro

iPhone 16 Pro Max

iPhone 15 Pro

iPhone 15 Pro Max

iPad Pro: M1 and later

Quick summary

Apple is preparing three generations of 5G modem with the first arriving in the 2025 iPhone SE 4.

The third generation may be coming to Macs and possibly Vision Pro too.

Some news pretends to be boring when it's far from it, and the stories around Apple's 5G modem definitely fall into that category. What sounds pretty dull – that Apple plans to swap a Qualcomm component for an Apple one – is likely to have a huge impact on the design of the iPhone, iPad and Mac too.

According to Bloomberg, Apple has a three-stage plan. Step one is to put an Apple modem into the iPhone SE 4 next year. Step two is to put a new modem in a radically redesigned iPhone 17. And, step three is to put the modem into iPads, Macs and possibly Vision Pro too.

That's going to have significant effects on the design of iPhones and iPads. But, it's the prospect of mobile Macs and a 5G Vision Pro that I think is particularly exciting.

Apple's modem plans are surprisingly exciting

According to Bloomberg, the first generation of the modem isn't particularly exciting; if anything, it's pretty basic compared to the 5G Qualcomm chips Apple currently uses. But, it's likely to use less power and to deliver more efficient network connectivity as well as improved support for satellite network features.

The second generation is expected to arrive in the iPhone 18 and high-end iPads and deliver a significant speed boost over the first generation. And in 2027, the third generation, currently codenamed Prometheus, is intended to outdo Qualcomm in performance, in satellite connectivity and in AI.

The first and most obvious change the new modem will deliver is the iPhone 17 Air, aka the iPhone Slim, which will take advantage of its more compact dimensions to deliver the thinnest iPhone yet. However, Apple is also reportedly considering using it in MacBooks and Vision Pro, although the use in augmented reality headsets is said to be ""years away"".

A 5G Mac is on many laptop owners' wishlists, including mine. I've been using an iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard for a few years now and it's pretty much the ideal mobile device – always-on internet is a genuine game changer when you're travelling or commuting. But of course, it's not a Mac, so it doesn't run a lot of key apps that would be deal-breakers for other people.

A mobile-friendly Mac is hardly a new idea for Apple. I've been reporting on Apple patents for mobile-connecting Macs for decades now, but it looks like this time around it's heading for the production line, possibly in just two or three years' time."

Video Transcript

- It's hard to imagine life without Apple, because my life has been wrapped up in this company, as you've mentioned, since 1998.

This is a long time.

It's the overwhelming majority of my adult life, and so I love it.

- I'm Steven Levy.

Today we sat down with Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss the company's past, present, and future.

This is ""The Big Interview.""

Thank you for doing ""The Big Interview,"" Tim.

- Thank you for being here, Steven.

It's always great to talk to you.

- Yeah, well it's great to be at Apple Park.

I'm looking this backdrop.

I remember you gave me a tour of this place.

- Yeah.

- Before people moved in.

And what about this place, working in here, and having your people in here is either unexpected or striking.

- It's promoted collaboration even more than I thought.

Advertisement Advertisement

And that was a key component of the design, as you know.

But there's so many places in here that you unexpectedly run into people.

You do it at the cafeteria, you do it at the coffee bar, you do it outside when you're going across the pathway.

And I think that promotes this unplanned collaboration.

And I think it's fantastic.

Also, there's a connection here to Steve.

You know, of course we have the theater named after him, and think about him all the time.

But I can feel him in other spaces in here.

He had a perspective that the venue that you worked in was so important to the work, and I think that he's been proven right.

- You mentioned the theater.

Will you do product launches now?

You do pre-tapes, or are you ever gonna see live launches in the Steve Jobs theater again like we used to?

- Maybe.

The thing that we learned during COVID was, you know, the audience is primarily an online audience.

Very few people can fit in the theater, and we wanted to have more people engaged in the announcements itself.

And you can do that a lot more productively on tape than you can in live, because of the transitions on the stage and so forth.

- But you don't miss the vibe.

- I do miss it.

I do miss it.

I get it when the WWDC is here, and we announced the film and feel the love from the developers is fantastic.

- I heard something interesting recently that Stevie Wonder had a demo of the Vision Pro and loved it.

How's that work?

- He's a friend of Apple.

It's great to get feedback from Stevie, and of course his artistry is just unparalleled.

He's so fantastic.

But accessibility was always important for us from designing all of our products, as you know, that's one of the common threads through Apple over time, is that we don't bolt on accessibility at the end of the design process, it's embedded in the design process.

And so getting that feedback was key.

- So I wanna look back a little bit through your time here.

Advertisement Advertisement

You've been here a long time.

You got here in 1998.

- That's right.

- There had already been eras of Apple.

There had been the Apple II era.

The Mac, the diaspora era where Steve was gone.

You were a compact.

Did you think that at any point watching what was going on that Apple was just not gonna make it?

- You know, I probably thought that before talking to Steve.

At that time, if you remember Michael Dell had said if he was the CEO, he would shut Apple down.

And just return whatever assets were left to the shareholders.

And Michael just said what most everyone else thought.

But I have to say, when I came out to talk to Steve about working at Apple, it felt so alive and so different.

Advertisement Advertisement

He was somebody that was the most unusual CEO I'd ever met.

He was passionate about the product, passionate about Apple, passionate about its reason for being its purpose.

And I thought, I've gotta do this.

I want to do this.

And from that point, I never thought that Apple would be going out of business.

And other people did, and other people advised me, why are you doing this?

You're leaving the world's largest personal computer company and going to one that may not survive.

But I didn't feel that way at that point after talking to Steve.

- So while you're here in your collaboration with Steve, you know, Apple came out with, you know.

These great design products, the iMac, then the iPod era, which was so exciting.

- That's right.

- There were so many different versions of iPods, then of course the iPhone.

- Yes.

- Looking back, what did you do that was smart that you really didn't think was going to be so impactful in making that product a success?

- Well, I think each product that you named sort of had its place in history.

The iMac revived Apple, it kind of proved Apple could survive.

The iPod giving people 1,000 songs in the pocket, something very unexpected, and solving a pain point that all of us had that loved music.

It began to introduce people to more people, particularly in the developed markets.

Advertisement Advertisement

And the decision to port to Windows proved that Apple could come out with a product that was larger than the Mac community.

And then iPhone built on everything that came before it.

And with the great work from the technology team on multi-touch, it gave you a totally different way of interfacing with the product.

And then what iPhone did looking back, was introduce people to Apple in the emerging markets.

Going out and forming all of these carry relationships was very important to introducing Apple more broadly and sort of turning the industry on its side and owning the design.

Because at that time, if you remember, the carrier was owning the design of the phone, was sort of directing it.

Advertisement Advertisement

And we said, no no, what we bring is the product skill.

And what they brought was the networking skill.

And we didn't have the networking skill and frankly they didn't have the product skill.

And so this combination was very powerful.

And the rest is history.

- Well, we're beginning maybe a new era of history now with AI.

Apple Intelligence.

- I mean, do you think this is something that is gonna wind up reinventing the company and reinventing the world?

Are you on the cusp of that?

- I do.

I think it's profound.

I think just like multi-touch enabled iPhone and eventually iPad, and the modern smartphone, and the modern tablet, AI will reinvent and it provide a new era and a new chapter for iPhone and iPad, and the Mac, and all of our products over time.

Because I think it changes the way you interface with the products.

I get so much out of Apple Intelligence, and we're just at the beginning.

- So Siri is one thing that's being revitalized here.

I'm wondering, are we going to eventually have this relationship with Siri that'll be our constant companion and we'll do, for instance, everything we might wanna do in search, instead of going to Google, we'll just ask Siri.

- We'll see.

But I think, I use Siri a lot now.

I'm a power user of Siri, and so I'm some of the billion five requests that Siri gets every day.

So I already have a relationship with Siri, but I think more people will, because Siri will become more personally relevant and be able to take task off your plate that you don't have to do.

And sort of a multi-step kind of approach that you saw some of the demos do.

So I couldn't be more excited about the future of Siri.

- You are the CEO.

You've been here for a while.

How long do you see yourself continuing this role?

- Oh, I don't know.

I get asked that question now more than I used to.

- Why is that?

As I age, as my hair turns gray, I love this place, Steven.

I love it.

And I love the people I work with.

It's a privilege of a lifetime to be here.

And I'll do it until the voice in my head says it's time.

And then I'll go and focus on what the next chapter looks like.

My life has been wrapped up in this company, as you mentioned, since 1998.

This is a long time.

It's the overwhelming majority of my adult life.

And so it's tough to envision life without Apple.

- So one more question.

When we were all talking about the tour and things like that, I was also doing a story about the Infinite Loop, One Infinite Loop.

That which used to be the Apple's headquarters.

- That's right.

- And you told me that you didn't move into Steve's office.

- I didn't.

- After he died, it was preserved.

- Yes.

- And that sometimes you would go in there.

- [Tim] Yes.

- And get inspired by being in the surroundings.

- [Tim] Yes.

- Do you still do that?

Is that office still preserved?

- I still do that.

The office is still preserved.

No one's ever moved in there.

And that's been since 2011 as you know.

Most of what we do is forward looking.

But I like my connection back to Steve, and I like the company's connection back to Steve, because from him emanates our values and our DNA.

So I think that connection's important.

- So Tim, thank you so much for doing ""The Big Interview.""

- Yeah, thank you.

It's so great to spend time with you.

- As always.

- I'll bump into you in Palo Alto again.

- Alright.

Yeah, in a few days.

- In a few days.

- Okay.

Thank you.

- Alright.

Battery life aside, which is much worse than both the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and the Google Pixel Watch 3, it’s the best Apple Watch I’ve ever used.

The Apple Watch comes with a host of features for tracking your fitness, including automatic detection of many different types of workouts, but the tracking of vital signs isn’t the most accurate. The Pixel Watch 3 solves this problem with the best heart rate tracking I’ve tried on a smartwatch, but it doesn’t have as many workout options as the Apple Watch, and automatic detection is inferior as well.

Both smartwatches only work with one mobile platform, but if you’re platform-agnostic and want something to track your fitness, which one should you buy? I took to the streets of Dubai on a recent vacation to answer this question. Here’s how they compared on a recent one-mile walk.

Both failed to detect the first walk

Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

My original plan had been to walk to the mall and back (0.8 miles total, according to Google Maps), but this plan fell apart when neither watch detected the walk after 0.2 miles. That’s half the distance one-way, and while I’ve had this concern with the Pixel Watch 3 before, the lack of detection on the Apple Watch was a genuine surprise.

Once I got to the mall. I manually activated the walk profile on both devices. It’s worth noting here that the Pixel Watch 3 has a single walking workout option, while the Apple Watch Series 10 has both indoor and outdoor walk options. I picked the indoor option as I was indoors, but this means it wasn’t trying to map my GPS route, whereas the Pixel Watch 3 was.

A few laps of the mall brought me to 0.6 miles on my pedometer, with the Apple Watch Series 10 tracking lower at 0.49 miles and the Pixel Watch 3 much higher at 0.74 miles.

Exploring the walk test data

Joe Maring / Digital Trends

The delta in the tracking of distance continued throughout. I’ve noticed before that the Pixel Watch 3 often tracks a longer distance, while the Apple Watch is usually slightly under. Each smartwatch uses algorithms and sensors to determine what movement to count and ignore, and each company still has some adjustments to make to be truly accurate.

Apple Watch Series 10 Google Pixel Watch 3 Duration 26:40 26:35 Distance 0.94 miles 1.15 miles Active calories 98.9 calories 245 calories Cardio Load / Workout Effort 4 4 Avg Heart rate 94 bpm N/A

At the end of the test, my total distance walked was 1.02 miles. The Pixel Watch 3 clocked in at 1.16 miles, while the Apple Watch Series 10 was at 0.95 miles. The Apple Watch Series 10 was technically more accurate, while I believe the Pixel Watch overcompensated for small movements.

Advertisement Advertisement

Beyond just distance, there was a disparity in the presumed calories burned. The Pixel Watch 3 says I burned 245 calories, while the Apple Watch Series 10 tracked this at just under 100 calories. Apple has a lot more historical data on me than Google does — both over several years and in recent weeks — and based on how I felt during the walk, the Apple Watch Series 10 feels more accurate in terms of data.

Diving into the heart rate data

Andy Boxall / Digital Trends

As I mentioned, I love the Pixel Watch 3 for its heart rate tracking. Throughout multiple tests over the past few months, it’s been more accurate than most wearables I’ve tested, and I’m more inclined to believe its heart rate stats over those of the competition. However, the Fitbit app makes it difficult to locate raw heart rate data after the workout, so the information below is anecdotally based on observing the Pixel Watch 3 during the walk.

According to the Pixel Watch, my heart rate fluctuated between 90 beats per minute (bpm) and 105, while the Apple Watch Series 10 mostly tracked it at 101 bpm. In the final results, the Pixel Watch 3 doesn’t display average heart rate data, and instead focuses on a cardio load factor of 4, while the Apple Watch Series 10 displayed an estimated workout effort score of 4 and an average heart rate of 94 bpm.

It’s worth noting the key differences between the two regarding heart rate tracking: the Pixel Watch 3 is designed to measure your heart rate once per second throughout the day, even at rest. Comparatively, the Apple Watch only updates every five minutes except in workout mode.

While the Pixel Watch 3 is more accurate at continuous heart rate monitoring than the Apple Watch, neither compares to wearing a dedicated heart rate monitor from Polar or a more fitness-focused device from companies like Garmin.

Key takeaways from the full experience

Joe Maring / Digital Trends

Beyond just heart rate, this test revealed a few other things. If you like to mix indoor and outdoor workouts, the Pixel Watch 3 is far better with its single profile, as starting an indoor walk on the Apple Watch Series 10 and then going outdoors doesn’t enable GPS tracking. That said, Apple displays the data in a more friendly and straightforward way than Google/Fitbit does.

The Fitbit app also takes much longer than the Apple Watch Series 10 to track and update your data, and if you’re new to Fitbit, the app’s layout is quite confusing. In particular, to access workout data, you need to go to the Today tab, then Exercise Days, and tap on each workout. It’s only a few taps, but I find far less intuitive than it should be, and it’s confusing to the point that even I had to double-check how to access the summary report. It’s also frustrating that you can’t access this data from the watch, but need to use the phone itself.

I also wish the Fitbit app would provide access to more granular data. Cardio Load and Target Load are excellent ways to help average customers become more fit every day, but the lack of granular heart data makes it less useful for those who want this additional info.

Which smartwatch is better for tracking workouts?

Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends

I was quite surprised by the lack of automatic workout detection on both devices. Each claims to automatically track your workouts, but neither activated the mode as I set off on my initial walk to the mall. While I expected this from the Pixel Watch 3, the Apple Watch Series 10 not prompting to track the workout was more surprising, given that Apple usually prompts fairly quickly.

Advertisement Advertisement

Both wearables track a great amount of data, but there’s a noticeable difference in how it’s displayed afterward. The Fitbit app makes it difficult to access raw, data but is far more friendly for average users, while Apple Health lays out data in a user-friendly way that allows you to access as much or as little data as you like.

The on-device experience is pretty similar between the two. Still, while I’m impressed with the Pixel Watch 3’s heart rate accuracy and cardio load feature, the lack of granular details means I’m more inclined to keep using the Apple Watch Series 10 to track all my workouts.

Though the latest versions of Apple’s devices have been out for weeks, that doesn’t mean the brand’s 2022 through 2023 models are completely old hat — older iPad Pro and MacBook Pro devices, for instance, are equipped with the M2 and M3 chips, which both deliver impressive performance for watching videos, playing mobile games, drawing or taking notes at school and work.

Why you should buy the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3

Our team is a big fan of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3. It currently holds the title as the very best MacBook you can buy in our rankings of the best MacBooks, and it all starts with the performance of Apple’s M3 chip. Combined with an eight-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, and 16GB of RAM, the Apple MacBook Air M3 will barely break a sweat when handling your daily activities — even when you’re multitasking between several apps.

Another important thing about the Apple MacBook Air M3 is that it’s simply stunning, with a beautiful design that’s just 0.44 inches thick and a gorgeous 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display that supports 1 billion colors. The efficiency of the processor allows it to go fanless, so it’s completely quiet while you’re using it, and its battery can last up to 18 hours from a full charge. The Apple MacBook Air M3 is also fitted with two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 5, a MagSafe 3 port for charging, and a headphone jack.

For Black Friday, Best Buy is selling the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3 with a 256GB SSD for only $849, a savings of $250 on the laptop’s original price of $1,099. It’s not a surprise that there’s high demand for Black Friday Apple deals, and this offer won’t be an exception. There’s a chance that this discount doesn’t make it through the rest of the weekend, so if you want to buy the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3 for less than $1,000, you should add it to your cart and proceed with the checkout process immediately.

iPhone 18.2 default apps

When Apple rolls out iOS 18.2 next month — likely in early December — it’s going to deliver several features that could change the way you use your iPhone.

You’ve undoubtedly seen the Apple Intelligence features — such as ChatGPT’s integration with Siri, as well as the ability to create AI-generated images from text commands — which have been featured in basically every iPhone commercial for the last several months.

But iOS 18.2 will also introduce several lesser-advertised features, some of which promise to be even more helpful.

One of them is Share Item Location, a feature that will allow you to temporarily share the location of a missing AirTag with an airline or a trusted person — i.e, a stranger — so they can help find it.

Maybe more significantly, iOS 18.2 will let you switch away from Apple’s default apps for things calling and messaging for the first time. You’ll also be able to switch the default apps for things like call filtering, passwords and keyboards.

You’ve previously been able to change away from Apple’s default apps for a select few things. For example, when iOS 14 rolled out a few years ago, you could change your iPhone’s default web browser and email apps away from Safari and Mail, respectively.

But this is a big change for anybody who wants to break a bit outside Apple’s app ecosystem.

How to Change Your iPhone’s Default Apps

When your iPhone is running iOS 18.2, you’ll be able to access a new Default Apps menu in the Settings app. You’ll be able to use this to easily change the default apps.

Open the Settings app. Scroll down to the bottom and select Apps. Select Default Apps at the top.

From here, you’ll be able to change away from Apple’s default apps for email, messaging, calling, call filtering, browser apps, passwords, wallets and keyboards.

The public beta of iOS 18.2 is available now. The official release of iOS 18.2 is expected in early December."

Pricing: From $799 to $1,599

Cost is a big factor when selecting a mobile phone. Even though most US buyers split the cost of new phones over 24 or 36 months via their service plan, every little decision adds up on that monthly bill. Here's a breakdown of iPhone pricing.

Apple charges $799 for the iPhone 16 with 128GB of storage, $899 for 256GB, or $1,099 for 512 GB. The iPhone 16 Plus models cost $100 more across the board, or $899 for the 128GB model, $999 for 256GB, or $1,199 for 512GB.

The Pro models carry an increase of $200. The iPhone 16 Pro with 128GB costs $999, the 256GB model costs $1,099, the 512GB model costs $1,299, and the 1TB model costs $1,499. Moving to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, you'll pay $1,199 for the 256GB model (there is no 128GB model), $1,399 for the 512GB model, or $1,599 for the 1TB model.

Advertisement Advertisement

If you're more interested in the monthly breakdown, you should expect to pay about $33 per month for two years for the base iPhone 16 and $67 per month for two years for the 1TB Pro Max iPhone. Those prices are valid if you finance the phone directly with Apple. Since AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon break down costs over three years, you can expect the monthly price to drop to about $22 for the base model and $44 for the top model. Your pricing will likely be different if you trade in an old iPhone.

Winner: Apple (ka-ching!)

Sizing and Design

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 families were available in two basic sizes, but Apple has expanded the lineup this year and now offers four sizes from which to choose.

The iPhone 16 is the smallest and lightest of the new iPhones, measuring 5.81 by 2.82 by 0.31 inches (HWD) and 6.00 ounces. The 16 Pro is slightly larger, measuring 5.89 by 2.81 by 0.32 inches and 7.03 ounces. Then comes the 16 Plus, which measures 6.33 by 3.06 by 0.31 inches and weighs 7.03 ounces. The Pro Max is the biggest and heaviest, measuring 6.42 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and 7.99 ounces. You can put the Pro Max in the ""pretty darned big"" category.

Advertisement Advertisement

In terms of design, the iPhone 16s aren't that hard to tell apart thanks to their different color palettes. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are available in five shades: Black, Pink, Teal, Ultramarine, or White. The 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max come in four options: Black Titanium, Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, or White Titanium.

The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are made with aluminum frames and Apple's Ceramic Shield, while the Pro models upgrade the frame to titanium. All four models have an IP68 rating for protection against dust and water.

The buttons and controls are identical. The left side features the Action Button and separate volume keys, while the right edge holds the power button and the Camera Control—this new feature lets you quickly open the camera and take photos or videos, as well as access tools like zoom by sliding your finger across the sapphire glass. None of the iPhones for US buyers has a physical SIM card because US iPhone models rely on eSIM only. International models do include a SIM card tray. Each iPhone has a USB-C port on the bottom, but they aren't all the same. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have USB 2.0 ports, while the 16 Pro and Pro Max have USB 3.1.

The biggest visual difference between the iPhones, other than their color, is the camera module. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have two camera lenses stacked vertically, and the 16 Pro and Pro Max have three cameras arranged in a triangle that rests on a large, squarish bump.

Winner: Tie

Screen Dimensions: It Matters

Four different-sized phones means four different-sized displays, measuring 6.1, 6.3, 6.7, and 6.9 inches. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus use Apple's Super Retina XDR OLED screen. It's a static screen at 60Hz and does not support the always-on display feature. The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 has a resolution of 2,556 by 1,179 pixels and a density of 460 pixels per inch (ppi), while the 6.7-inch 16 Plus has a resolution of 2,796 by 1,290 pixels at 460ppi.

The Pro models upgrade the screen to a variable refresh rate display that Apple brands as ProMotion. The refresh rate can range from 1Hz to save power up to 120Hz for smoother performance. This screen supports an always-on display option. The 6.3-inch 16 Pro has a resolution of 2,622 by 1,206 pixels at 460ppi, while the 6.9-inch Pro Max has a resolution of 2,868 by 1,320 pixels at 460ppi. The Pro Max has the largest-ever screen on an iPhone.

All four iPhones produce 1,000 nits of brightness (typical), with HDR brightness reaching 1,600 nits and peak brightness reaching 2,000 nits. They support a contrast ratio of 2 million to 1 and include a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro Max

Apple Silicon: What's a Pro Chip?

According to Apple's spec sheets, a single GPU core is all that separates the A18 processor in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus from the A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. Based on the chip's architectural diagram, the A18 includes two performance cores, four efficiency cores, five GPU cores, and 16 Neural Engine cores (or NPU). The A18 Pro adds a single GPU core, giving it six instead of five.

There are almost certainly numerous other differences that Apple isn't defining. For example, Apple doesn't spell out the clock speeds for the CPU cores. It's possible the A18 Pro has higher clock speeds than the A18. We do know that all four iPhones share the same amount of RAM, which is believed to be 8GB.

Advertisement Advertisement

Unsurprisingly, in our in-depth comparison, we found the A18 Pro chip outperformed the A18 chip. On average, it is about 10% better across a variety of benchmarks, though it did particularly well in GPU tests, which give the Pro models an edge when it comes to Apple Intelligence.

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max

Battery: From 18 to 29 Hours

Apple does not share details on the capacity of iPhone batteries, but analysis of the phones suggests the iPhone 16 has a 3,561mAh battery, the 16 Plus has a 4,674mAh battery, the 16 Pro has a 3,582mAh battery, and the 16 Pro Max has a 4,685mAh battery. Further, the company quantifies battery life by how many hours the devices can perform specific tasks, none of which include ""regular use.""

The iPhone 16 can play local video files for up to 22 hours, stream online video files for up to 18 hours, and play audio for up to 80 hours. Those numbers increase to 27, 24, and 100 hours, respectively, for the iPhone 16 Plus. The Pro model batteries typically last longer. Apple says the 16 Pro can play local video files for up to 27 hours, stream online video files for up to 22 hours, and play audio for up to 85 hours. Those battery life ratings increase to 22, 29, and 105 hours, respectively, for the 16 Pro Max.

Our own tests provided different results. We found the iPhone 16 lasted 17 hours and 47 minutes, the iPhone 16 Plus lasted 21 hours and 51 minutes, the iPhone 16 Pro lasted 20 hours and 33 minutes, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasted 22 hours and 5 minutes.

Advertisement Advertisement

As far as charging is concerned, each iPhone 16 supports MagSafe wireless charging at up to 25W, Qi2 charging at up to 15W, and regular Qi charging at 7.5W. Apple does not disclose the wired charging speeds, though reports suggest all four models support up to 45W wired charging. That has yet to be confirmed.

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro Max

Cameras: Do You Want Zoom?

Camera functionality is one of the bigger differentiators between the new iPhones. The regular models have two rear cameras, while the Pro phones have three. The Pro iPhones also get more advanced videography features. Here's the breakdown:

The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus share their camera arrangement. Each has a 48MP f/1.6 main camera. Apple brands this the Fusion camera because the sensor can take 48MP images at 1x, 12MP images at 2x, or combined 24MP images that blend the detail of all 48MP with the light-capturing power of the 12MP binned sensor. The 12MP ultrawide camera has a 120-degree field of view with support for macro shooting.

The Pro models have a similar 48MP main camera with an f/1.78 and optical image stabilization. It, too, can capture 48MP or 24MP images, in addition to 12MP 2x telephoto shots. The 48MP ultrawide offers a 120-degree field of view at f/2.2 and can snag full 48MP resolution pictures. A dedicated 12MP 5x optical telephoto camera is available to both iPhone 16 Pro models.

Advertisement Advertisement

Apple says the iPhone 16 supports up to 10x zoom via cropping with the main sensor. The Pro models support up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom via optical zoom and cropping. As far as shooting photos is concerned, that's the biggest difference.

The TrueDepth camera, or selfie camera, appears to be identical across all four iPhone 16s. It's a 12MP shooter at f/1.9. The Pro models can shoot in ProRAW, while the non-Pro models are limited to HEIF or jpeg.

Looking at the video capabilities paints a different picture. All the iPhones can shoot 1080p or 4K video at 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames per second in Dolby Vision. You also get Cinematic Mode, Action Mode (at 2.8K), slow motion, time-lapse, and spatial video capture (for the Apple Vision Pro). The Pro models add Fusion capture at up to 4K120, so you can get incredibly smooth action or slow things down after the fact with 4x slow motion. The Pros also get ProRes capture at 4K120, Log video recording, and Academy Color Encoding System. Last, they have stabilized sensors and include four microphones for improved audio recording.

If you're a serious video creator, the Pro models are for you.

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max

Anything Else?

Most other specs and features are shared across all iPhone 16 models. For example, they have the same sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G support, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and Thread radios. The only difference is that the Pro models have dual-band GPS while the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have single-band GPS.

Everyone gets Emergency SOS via satellite, Crash Detection, Roadside Assistance via satellite, Messages via satellite, and Find My via satellite for safety. All the iPhones ship with iOS 18 and will receive the same amount of software support.

Winner: Tie

Verdict: We're All Winners

Apple makes different iPhones for different people. The iPhone 16 will likely be the best iPhone for most people thanks to its balance of price and features. Those who want something bigger but want to keep the price in check can get the 16 Plus instead. Want a better camera system but like things small? Go with the iPhone 16 Pro. Last, if you want it all, Apple will happily take your money for the 16 Pro Max."

I still remember when Apple released the first iPad mini. Before getting my hands on one, I thought to myself, ""Why not just use your phone?""

The first time I tried it, I understood. It was easier to type on and fit in only one hand, two things I couldn't say about its full-size sibling, but with so much more screen space than a phone.

Now the brand-new iPad mini is already on sale, so you can hold all of that power in the palm of your hand for less.

Why is this a good deal? 💰

A $49 discount might seem pretty small, but any discount on a brand-new Apple item is noteworthy, especially when it comes to iPads, which tend to hold their value. Priced at $450, this iPad mini with 128GB of memory has never been cheaper.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Think this is just a slightly larger version of your phone? Think again. With a 3:2 aspect ratio compared to the iPhone's 2:1, the iPad mini is much wider and, for those who use their tablets to read, can fit more text and feels more like a book or magazine in your hand. Speaking of fitting in your hand, it's much less cumbersome than the full-size iPad, making it great for travel or slipping into a backpack for your commute.

As far as features go, the iPad mini is packed. It's powered by the A17 Bionic chip, so you should experience zero lag (which I definitely cannot say for my Kindle). It also has a 12-megapixel camera on both the front and back, plus, with its smaller size, you won't look ridiculous holding it up to snap a photo. The optional (but highly recommended) Apple Pencil Pro can turn this tablet into an art studio, whether your medium is photography or digital art.

This is also the first time an iPad mini will have Apple Intelligence. What is Apple Intelligence, you ask? It's Apple's way of making your device even more helpful and personalized. It learns from your habits and preferences to suggest things like reminders for meetings, suggest photos from specific events or even offer predictive text while you type, making things run smoother and faster.

Coupled with the optional Apple Pencil, the iPad mini becomes a powerhouse of an art studio. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

Since this iPad is so new, it has only a handful of ratings on Amazon so far, most of them five-star. Unsurprisingly, the previous-generation iPad mini has received quite a few five-star ratings — close to 10,000, in fact, from shoppers who say it's ""a compact powerhouse.""

Pros 👍

Portability seems to be one of the biggest draws, including for this five-star reviewer. ""I use my iPad for reading, streaming movies/TV shows, as a planner, as a coloring book and sketchbook, and surfing the internet. I also purchased an Apple Pencil, second generation, and I purchased a Paperlike screen protector — it helps me write easier and smoother on it. I love this thing! It's perfect to take literally anywhere and fits in most of my purses.""

""I am coming from the iPad mini 5th generation and wow is this a huge step up,"" said another happy customer. ""It is super fast. Great feel, quality and awesome camera. The picture quality is unreal. It is very portable even with a case on it. The storage is great. I have 30GB free even after the new iOS install.""

""I had been looking for something to take quick notes at work, edit PDFs for simple stuff at work and home, and I had really been getting sick of reading on my phone,"" shared a final five-star buyer. ""We have an iPad Pro 10-inch and the new 10th generation Air, and none of them seem to perform any better than mine does, but the big thing about it that is huge for me is that it is so small and light, super easy to tote around, doesn't really add any weight to my bag.""

Cons 👎

""I will say, battery life is subpar, especially when compared with my older iPad Pro,"" cautioned one purchaser. ""The 2021 iPad Mini and 2022 iPad Air that I own don't have the best battery life, but at least they charge up quickly with the included USB-C charger. I guess the newer models don't hold a charge as long, but when I travel, I bring an Anker portable battery with me, just in case.""

Some users also miss the home button, which Apple no longer includes on the iPad mini. ""You sort of have to fling things off the screen,"" said this user. ""If you like that, it probably works for you. I do not. Takes a while getting used to, and I don't think I ever totally will.""

If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)

Apple devices have a few things in common: they’re well-designed, solidly built and easily connect with one another. But chances are, if it bears the Apple logo, it’s not cheap. That’s why promos like Black Friday are always worth checking out if you’re in the market for a new Apple device. We’ve reviewed nearly every major release from the company over the last 20 years, including the newest products for 2024, like the AirPods 4, the M4 iPad Pro, the M4 Mac Mini and more. Some of those devices are seeing their first discounts for Black Friday and others are dipping back to the lows they saw earlier in the year. Here are the best Apple Black Friday deals we could find from retailers across the web.

The line between Apple’s tablets and laptops is a little blurry at this point, especially with the release of the iPad Pro this year, which (at the time) housed the company’s most powerful chip. The iPad Air is our current pick for the best iPad you can buy and we were delighted by the iPad mini that came out just last month. The only problem is iPads are among the more expensive tablets you can buy. Hopefully these Black Friday iPad deals help out.

The best Black Friday Apple AirPods deals

Apple refined the shape on the AirPods 4 for a better fit.

Apple has four models of AirPods right now: The AirPods Pro 2, the over-ear AirPods Max and two AirPods 4, one with active noise cancellation and one without. Apple has been doing a lot of interesting things with their headphones lately, making this a good time to dive in. Though the discounts for Black Friday look to be minor, it's better than paying full price.

Apple appears to have quietly discontinued a popular accessory that was once essential for some iPhone users.

The 3.5mm Lightning to Headphone Jack Adapter has been sold out on both the UK and US Apple websites for some time now.

The device allowed users to connect iPhones without a headphone jack to a wide range of devices, including wired headphones, speakers, car audio systems and airplane entertainment.

As Apple shifts away from its proprietary Lightning port in favor of USB-C, this once-common and necessary accessory may be gone for good.

The adapter first launched in 2016 alongside the iPhone 7, marking Apple’s controversial decision to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack from the device.

This change left many iPhone users with a dilemma: their older wired headphones or non-Apple headphones, were no longer compatible. The Lightning to 3.5mm Adapter provided a solution, allowing users to continue using their existing headphones with the new iPhones.

The phase-out of the Lightning connector has been gradual, with the iPhone 15 marking the official shift to USB-C in 2023.

For years, the adapter was included with every new iPhone from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone XS, released in 2018.

By then, however, many iPhone owners had switched to wireless options like the Lightning EarPods or Bluetooth AirPods, and the adapter was no longer bundled with the device. It continued to be sold separately at Apple stores for around $9, but now it appears to be disappearing from stores altogether.

While the Lightning to 3.5mm Adapter is no longer available in the UK and US, it can still be found in some countries such as France, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.

They are also still available for purchase on some un-Apple-affiliated sites, including Amazon.

While this change has been met with frustration by some die-hard iPhone users, it is clear that Apple is fully committed to USB-C as the future of its devices.

Apple has not addressed the situation or responded to The Post’s request to comment."

Chances are someone on your holiday shopping list is asking for a fresh pair of AirPods, which are currently discounted up to 24 percent. After Apple’s latest AirPods release (AirPods 4 are currently modestly discounted on Amazon if you’d like to shave a few dollars off of the newest model), we expected to see savings on previous generations, including the AirPods Pro 2—and they delivered.

Not only do both of these models boast noise-canceling tech, but they’re also sweat- and water-resistant, making them solid choices for exercising. For anyone who prefers over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max, complete with memory foam ear cushions, are discounted by 18 percent for Black Friday.

Apple's new Mac mini hasn’t been available for that long yet, but you can already grab it at a discount. The M4-powered Mac mini has dropped to an all-time low of $500 thanks to a discount and an additional, clippable coupon that will bring the final price down to $500. That’s a total of $100 of savings off the original price of the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

The 2024 Mac Mini is available with an M4 or M4 Pro chip, both of which give the desktop computer a real boost from its previous version. We gave the upgrade a 90 in our review, in part due to the Pro's perks (which we'll get into later), but also general features like the base level being 16GB of RAM. This generation also offers front USB-C and headphone ports, as well as a design that's less than half the size of its predecessor.

The Mac Mini with M4 chip should be plenty of power for all your basic tasks. But, if you need a bigger boost, then check out Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chip. It's currently on sale for $1,270, down from $1,370, due to a $100 coupon available on the product page. This deal is available on the model with 24GB of unified memory and 512GB of SSD storage. It's remarkably fast and offers Thunderbolt 5 support, rather than the M4's Thunderbolt 4. Thunderbolt 5 can triple data transfer speeds to 120GB/s, up from 40GB/s.

Quick Summary

Apple's smart home tablet, tipped for an early 2025 release, will resemble a small iPad, it is claims.

A report says that it'll also have an interface similar to the iPhone's standby mode.

As we reported last week, Apple is working on a smart home ""wall tablet"" that it plans to launch in early 2025. However, there are now more details about what it'll potentially do, and why it could be important.

Advertisement Advertisement

The device is said to be the first of a series of smart home devices Apple is reportedly working on, including a home hub that can move courtesy of a robotic arm and possibly even an Apple-branded TV. That last one is a very big maybe, but according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman Apple is seriously considering it.

Here's what we think we know.

Apple's home tablet could finally deliver on Apple's promises

The new device will reportedly be similar in size to two iPhone 16s stuck together, and it'll have an interface that feels like a combination of watchOS and the Standby Mode for iPhone. It's going to be available in a choice of silver and black, Gurman says in his latest Power On newsletter, and it'll look like ""a low-end iPad"".

He claims that the tablet-style device will have a non-removable rechargeable battery, a built-in FaceTime camera and speakers, and it'll have sensors that enable it to detect your distance from the screen. You'll be able to stick it on your wall, or buy a base with additional speakers to turn it into a desktop or bedside device.

Apple apparently imagines ""people FaceTiming each other from different rooms"", using the tablet to pull up security camera footage, controlling their smart home kit and controlling the music on their HomePod speakers. It won't have its own App Store but it will have Siri and most likely Apple Intelligence too.

It sounds like a vast improvement over Apple's current smart home efforts, and with Apple on board with Matter, the smart home interoperability standard, the HomeKit platform is less of a walled garden than it used to be.

However, if Apple doesn't price this really aggressively it could have difficulty in getting people interested in an iPad-esque device that doesn't do as much as an iPad does.

It's definitely one to keep an eye on, though."

Despite its expected September 2025 release schedule, the iPhone 17 lineup is already generating some buzz. That interest is partially thanks to the rumored inclusion of a first-ever wildly thin iPhone model called the iPhone 17 Air.

Obviously, we don't know the name for sure, but Apple's rumored, thin smartphone is also being referred to as the iPhone 17 Slim, though Bloomberg's Mark Gurman seems to think Apple will go with the 'Air' naming convention to boost sales — an idea first suggested by Apple leaker and YouTuber Jon Prosser.

Whatever the name ends up being, we've rounded up the best leaks and rumors about the iPhone Air's specs, price, release date, and more.

iPhone 17 Air rumors: Latest news

iPhone 17 Air rumors: Release date & price

It's still early days for the iPhone 17 Air, so rumors about its price aren't as solid as rumors about its specs and features. That said, there are a few ideas swirling around about its potential price tag.

In a report from The Information, it's said the iPhone 17 Air ""could be priced higher than the iPhone Pro Max."" The iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199 right now, so the iPhone 17 Air could very well start at $1,299 or higher.

This rumor matches up with rumors from July 2024 that a 'Slim' iPhone would become the most premium model in the iPhone lineup. However, rumored specs up to this point indicate the iPhone 17 Air will feature lower-end specs compared to the Pro Max, so a higher price doesn't make the most sense.

Another rumor from analyst Jeff Pu via an investor note seen by 9to5Mac suggests the iPhone 17 Air may act as a ""replacement"" for the iPhone's ""Plus"" model. If Pu means the Air model would fully replace the Plus model in the iPhone 17 lineup, then the Air's starting price could match or hover around the iPhone 16 Plus' $899 starting price.

When it comes to a release date, Apple is much more predictable. The iPhone 17 Air, if it exists, will likely launch in September 2025, along with the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup.

iPhone 17 Air rumors: Specs

None of the following specs have been confirmed by Apple yet, but here's what we've heard so far from leakers and analysts regarding the iPhone 17 Air's possible specs.

iPhone 17 Air rumors: Design & display

The iPad Pro M4 is the thinnest product Apple has ever made — even thinner than the iPod Nano — and the company reportedly has plans to bring that sleek, thin design to the iPhone, MacBook, and Apple Watch.

The iPhone 17 Air was originally thought to be much thinner than the iPhone 16's 7.8-millimeter depth. However, according to a leak reported on by MacRumors, it might not be impressively thin like we were first expecting.

The leak mentions Apple's original plans to reduce thickness by manufacturing a battery with a thinner substrate, but the cost and tech involved made it an impractical solution. The battery will supposedly be around 6mm thick, and with all the extra materials around it, it'll likely be larger than the smallest iPhone ever, the iPhone 6 at just 6.9mm thick.

Compared to the 13-inch iPad Pro M4's thickness of just 5.1mm, the iPhone 17 Air's thickness will pale in comparison, but it should still be noticeably thinner than the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup.

3D render of the iPhone SE 4 and iPad mini 7 based on information gathered from rumors and leaks. Two iPhone SE 4 smartphones sit on top of an iPad mini 7, one is facing up to show its display, the other is facing down to show its back and camera array.

Many rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will adopt a fully aluminum casing, in an effort to make the phone feel lighter. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, however, thinks the phone's chassis will be constructed of both aluminum and titanium, ""with a lower percentage of titanium than the current Pro and Pro Max metal frames.""

As for its display, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch display with a 2,740 x 1,260-pixel resolution, ProMotion capabilities with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, and potentially a smaller camera cutout, thanks to Apple's rumored ""metalens"" technology.

A leaker on Weibo (via MacRumors) says all iPhone 17 models will adopt a ""super-hard AR (anti-reflective) layer"" that's ""more scratch-resistant"" than the existing outer glass. Then, there's also a slim possibility that the iPhone 17 Air could be one of the first to sport an OLED display panel (via Tom's Guide).

iPhone 17 Air rumors: Cameras

For the longest time, iPhones either have two or three cameras in the rear camera array. With the iPhone 17 Air, however, the company might shake things up and risk upsetting the Apple cart.

iphone 16 back

According to a research note by industry analyst Jeff Pu (seen by MacRumors), the iPhone 17 Air will reportedly be getting a single 48-megapixel rear wide camera, similar to what's expected for the iPhone SE 4.

This means it'd be adopting the same main rear camera found in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, but ditching the 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. If the 17 Air's price is to remain the same as the existing 16 Plus model, this camera omission will definitely be an issue.

On the front, the selfie camera will reportedly be getting an upgrade, leaving its 12-megapixel camera behind in favor of a much better 24-megapixel camera. This change is supposed to be hitting all iPhone 17 models, not just the Air.

iPhone 17 Air rumors: Outlook

While I'm hoping the iPhone 17 Air will indeed be the thinnest iPhone Apple's ever made, that doesn't seem likely right now. Larger batteries (which give people the all-day battery life they want) simply don't allow for incredibly thin phones.

That said, it could be a welcome addition to the iPhone 17 lineup. Right now, the biggest thing that differentiates the base iPhone 16 from its Plus counterpart is screen size. Replacing the Plus model with a thinner Air model could make it stand out as the phone you buy when you want a large display and a thin, lightweight form factor, and make fewer people opt for the base variant.

Expect more info to arrive as we push ahead into next year and approach WWDC 2025. As an iPhone gets closer to its release date, we often start seeing more leaks of both info and photos, so stay tuned.

Even better, there's a discount on what we reckon is the best laptop for most people and the best laptop for college students. Apple's M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM has dropped to its lowest price to date. The laptop is available for $849, which is $250 off the list price.

It's not possible to upgrade the RAM in an Apple Silicon MacBook, but you can always add external storage if need be.

Apple just released its first M4-powered Macs, but it has yet to slot the latest chip into the MacBook Air. The 13-inch MBA's blend of power and portability makes it a potent choice and we gave it a score of 90 in our review. It delivers fast performance and has a killer display. The design is sleek and sturdy and it sounds great thanks to a quad-speaker array. We like the trackpad and keyboard as well, while the upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E connectivity is a definite plus.

Our main quibble is that the USB-C ports are on the same side of the unit as the one for the charger — having even one USB-C on the right side would be handy. But that's a minor complaint about an otherwise terrific laptop.

You don't have to look too hard to find Black Friday deals on Apple devices. For one thing, the Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to a new all-time-low price on Amazon. The wearable can be yours for $329. That's $70 off, or a discount of 18 percent. That price is for the smaller 42mm model without LTE functionality. However, the 46mm variant is also $70 off at $359.

The Apple Watch Series 10 is our pick for the best smartwatch overall, but it's probably best to look at other options if you're an Android user. After all, you'll need a compatible iPhone to set up the wearable and get the most out of it. For Apple users who are after something a little simpler than the flagship model, the Apple Watch SE has also dropped to a record low price ($149) for Black Friday.

We gave the Apple Watch Series 10 a score of 90 in our review. Apple redesigned the smartwatch to offer a larger screen and thinner frame, both of which were plus points in our book. The wide-angle OLED panel offers better viewing angles. The wearable has in-depth fitness and health tracking too, with new functions including sleep apnea detection.

We found that there was a slight increase in battery life thanks to efficiency improvements, but some alternative smartwatches run for much longer on a single charge. Overall, this is a somewhat iterative update compared with the Series 9 and 8, but if you're upgrading from an older Apple Watch (or buying one for the first time), you may find the features, performance and charging speed to be impressive.

Apple yesterday announced Final Cut Pro 11 for Mac (the 'X' branding was dropped in 2020). Headline features include AI assisted tools such as Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions – and they're causing a stir amongst the creative community.

Designed to take ""full advantage of Apple's M-series chips"", the new Mac version of Final Cut Pro perhaps represents Apple's most confident embracing of AI yet. Both Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions are billed as tools that are only made possible by Apple’s Neural Engine. Take a look at our guide to the best video editing software for more options.

Final Cut Pro 11

""In Final Cut Pro 11, editors can access two all-new AI-powered tools: Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions, Apple announced. ""With Magnetic Mask, editors can effortlessly isolate people and objects in a video clip without the need for a green screen or more time-consuming rotoscoping. This powerful and precise automatic analysis provides additional flexibility to customize backgrounds and environments. Editors can also combine Magnetic Mask with color correction and video effects, allowing them to precisely control and stylize each project. And with Transcribe to Captions, closed captions can be automatically generated in the timeline using an Apple-trained large language model that transcribes spoken audio.""

The update has excited creatives, and many are already speculating that it could spell doom for some competitors. ""MotionVFX are trying to charge like $40 a month for rotoscoping and apple just drops it in for free!"" one Redditor comments, while another adds, ""Yep, cancelling my MotionVFX subscription.""

Advertisement Advertisement

Indeed, the update does appear to continue Apple's longstanding tradition of ""Sherlocking"" small apps – that is, dropping their main features into its existing apps. But for those looking to add automatic captions to videos, it might not be time to switch to Final Cut just yet. One Redditor says Transcribe to Captions is *very* basic for now. Just basic closed captions / subtitles, not any kind of solution to replace CapCut for those social media style videos.""

Final Cut Pro 11

Of course, the real competitors to Final Cut Pro are the likes of Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve. Time will tell whether Final Cut Pro 11 manages to bring the fight to their doorstep, but with its recent propose acquisition of Pixelmator, we've already speculated that Apple seems to be making major moves against Adobe right now.

Final Cut Pro 11 is available today as a free update for existing users and for $299.99 for new users on the Mac App Store. New users can download a free 90-day trial of Final Cut Pro."

Every couple of weeks a new rumor sprouts up claiming that Apple is working on an iPad-esque smart home display. Most of them have come from the Apple whisperer, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

This week, Gurman is back with a new set of rumors regarding the potential smart home device, which he says will launch in March of 2025.

The long-hinted at device is supposed to be wall-mounted ""command center"" that can control smart home devices, take video calls and use voice-activated Siri commands. It's very reminiscent of the Amazon Echo Hub or the Google Nest Hub, which currently offers a number of similar features.

Both the Echo and Nest offer pretty clear interfaces with integrations for other smart products like Ring cams or Nest thermostats. They're two of the best smart home hubs and stiff competition for Apple.

According to Gurman, Apple will announce the controller in early March of next year. Apparently, the product, code-named J490, will also launch a custom version of Apple Intelligence, described as a ""blend of watchOS and iOS StandBy Mode."" Apparently, the UI is ""dynamic"" and will shift based on your proximity.

While the display will be touched based, the main control will be voice via Siri and Apple Intelligence. Apparently, it's designed around something called ""App Intents,"" which is a platform that lets AI ""precisely control applications and tasks."" This platform is supposed to debut in the coming months. Thought it's not clear if that means it will launch with the rumored smart home device or before.

The device is supposed to feature a six-inch display, built-in camera, rechargeable battery and speakers.

Apple's first smart home hub

Assuming the rumors are true, Apple is looking to offer a centralized solution to controlling HomeKit-compatible smart home devices like lights, thermostats and security cameras.

It sounds like Apple will create a variety of attachments, including the wall-mount and several different bases with speakers that can be placed around the home. Sources say that Apple is looking at the device as a way to FaceTime while cooking or videoconference for meetings.

It's supposed to feature sensors that detect how many people are nearby and Apple's Handoff feature that lets you move tasks from device to device. As an example, you could trigger a function on the smart home tablet and then continue it on your iPhone.

The device is standalone and, according to Gurman, Apple imagines that people will buy multiple units of the device that are spread through your home.

Apple is also allegedly looking ahead to the future where the company might create a robotic limb that holds the display and could potentially follow you around your home. That idea has been rumored before and has a potential $1,000 price tag. It reminds us of Meta's failed Portal project, which was cut in 2022 amidst a slashing of budgets and mass layoffs at the company. The robotic limb might get an AI-personality, that is supposed to be an ""AI companion in your home or workspace.""

Allegedly, Apple is looking to price its smart home panel in the range of the Echo Hub and Nest Hub Max, which sell for $180 and $230, respectively. It's supposed to come out in silver and black."

Apple first announced the Apple Watch Series 10 over two months ago. At the time, it revealed three sharp-looking link bracelets to complement the higher-end titanium models, which are available in natural, slate and gold.

While these link bracelets have been available in natural and slate finishes since launch, the gold version has been MIA. That’s just changed.

A Gold Link Bracelet

The gold version of Apple’s Link Bracelet is exactly like the natural and slate versions. It’s comprised of over 100 components, each of which is made of 316L stainless steel alloy.

According to Apple, the machining process to create these link bracelets is so precise that “it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band.”

Several of the links have a simple release button, making it easy to add or remove links — no special tools required — and help you get the perfect fit.

Each link bracelet features a custom butterfly closure.

Price and availability

Apple’s Gold Link Bracelet is available for order right now on the company’s website, but there’s a catch. If ordered today, expect it to arrive between December 20th and 30th — so there’s a change it won’t arrive before Christmas.

The Gold Link Bracelet is available in two sizes, each to fit the two sizes of the Series 10: 42mm and 46mm. Both sizes cost $349.

The smaller 42mm and larger 46mm sizes will work with older Apple Watch models that came in 41mm and 45mm sizes, respectively. The larger model will work with the Ultra and Ultra 2, which only comes in one 49mm size.

Sure, you could already share an item’s location with people in your contacts list, but Apple says this could help when you have to rely on the help of a stranger.

When you choose Share Item Location in the Find My app on iPhone, iPad or Mac, you get the option to share a link that shows the location of your missing item. The link’s recipient will be able to open it on any device, and they’ll also be able to see your Apple account email and/or phone number so they can get in touch with you. You can even share the information with selected airlines. Apple has apparently worked with several carriers to integrate this feature into their systems.

Better still, air transport tech company SITA is also incorporating Share Item Location into WorldTracer, its baggage-tracing system. Apple says more than 500 airlines and ground handlers at 2,800-plus airports use it. Perfect for when I head to Portugal in just five days’ time. Yes, brag.

For now, it’s part of the public beta, so if you want the feature, you’ll have to install iOS 18.2.

Quick Summary

Apple is planning to launch a wireless smart home security camera in 2026, claims an industry insider.

The camera is expected to integrate with Apple's home platform, Siri, and Apple Intelligence.

Smart home security is one of the biggest areas for smart tech, but the choice for Apple users isn't huge. When I was looking for one of the best video doorbells to integrate with my Apple HomeKit home, the choice was very small (I ended up with a Eufy, which uses its own app instead). However, that could change.

Advertisement Advertisement

According to a respected industry insider, Apple plans to sell ""tens of millions"" of its own smart home security camera from 2026.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has a long track record of revealing Apple's plans and in a new post on Medium , he writes that the company is ""making its first foray into the smart home IP camera market"". He also predicts that the first devices will be launched in two years time.

But, to say that it'll sell so many devices from the off is ambitious – as Kuo says, global IP camera shipments are currently 30-40 million units per year, and Apple's entering the market completely cold.

What to expect from Apple's smart home security cameras

Apple clearly believes it's got something that rival smart home platforms haven't: Siri, in its new Apple Intelligence era.

It's also part of a much bigger smart home push. As we've previously reported , Apple is believed to be working on multiple smart home products including a smart home hub and a new HomePod-style device with a display in a design that resembles the old anglepoise iMac.

Apple is also reportedly working on robots, although that's likely to be much longer term.

In terms of what features this new camera may have, the only detail Kuo has shared is that it'll be wireless. Apple doesn't tend to go in at the low end of any market, though, so it's safe to predict that any such camera will have both a higher spec and a higher price than existing options from rivals, such as Ring."

The M4 Mac mini's new scaled-down design was supposed to be the highlight of its launch during Apple's M4 Mac week, but one design flaw has been stealing the show.

The Mac mini has its power button on the bottom, leading some users to come up with creative work arounds — like 3D printing power button extenders.

It's a little thing (literally), but the placement of the power button on the redesigned Mac mini is all Mac fans have been talking about since it was announced. Apple finally responded in an interview last week, but their take on the power button controversy might not be what users want to hear.

""You pretty much never use the power button on your Mac""

M4 Mac mini

Apple executives John Ternus, VP of Hardware Engineering, and Greg ""Joz"" Joswiak, VP of Worldwide Marketing, finally broke Apple's silence on the Mac mini power button controversy in an interview posted to Bilibili, a Chinese video-sharing platform, on November 7. The interview is in Chinese, but English transcripts reveal Apple's take on the power button.

When asked about it, one of the Apple executives commented, ""The most important thing is, you pretty much never use the power button on your Mac.""

Ternus and Joswiak also emphasized that the M4 Mac mini's ultra-compact design forced Apple to put the power button on the bottom. This may also be an attempt to steer the narrative around the M4 Mac mini back to its snack-sized redesign, but is it a fair way of shaking off users' complaints about the design?

That depends on how you see the Mac mini. It's designed to be a desktop PC and people who use it that way might agree with Ternus and Joswiak's point about rarely needing to use the power button. After all, it's easier to simply shut down your Mac through the shutdown menu in macOS, rather than use the physical button.

However, this simplified take ignores the unique position of the new Mac mini. It's so small that users can easily unplug it and travel with it like a laptop. Of course, you need to plug it into a monitor at the office or school to use it away from home, but it's still worth considering given how small the new Mac mini is. People who bring their Mac mini on the go with them are much more likely to use the physical power button since they will need to turn their Mac on and off much more often.

Ultimately, the placement of the Mac mini's power button is not a deal breaker, much like the inconvenient placement of the charging port on the Magic Mouse. However, it's disappointing to see design oversights like this from a brand that prides itself on great design.

Personally, I would have preferred a power button on the top or side disguised with the same metallic finish as the rest of the Mac mini's chassis. Even so, it's still impressive just how small the new mini is. It came close to design perfection this time, so maybe Apple will relocate that pesky power button next time around.

Quick Summary

US researchers have successfully used Power-over-Skin technology to power small wearable devices.

Instead of a battery they receive energy transmitted via your skin, so could be transformative for future smartwatches – like the Apple Watch.

The big challenge with wearable devices is how to power them. While battery technology in the likes of the Apple Watch and AirPods has improved enormously in recent years, it's still something of an Achilles heel for our devices.

However, a new innovation in the area could improve things – by taking the batteries out of smaller wearables altogether.

Called Power-over-Skin, the tech, as you've no doubt gathered from the name, uses your skin as a crucial component in the device ecosystem. Instead of having batteries in individual wearables, you have one single power source that uses your skin as a giant wireless power pack.

Will your skin power up your AirPods or Apple Watch?

It's not yet ready to work on the likes of Apple's earbuds or Watch, but the technology, as outlined in a research paper from Carnegie Mellon University and reported by Techradar , is promising.

It's based on the discovery that human skin is an effective transmitter of energy at 40MHz, and so far the researchers have used it with an LED earring, a calculator, and a Bluetooth ring.

We're not talking huge amounts of energy here – microwatts rather than watts – so you can forget about charging a MacBook Pro with skin power unless you fancy plugging yourself into the mains. The transmission power also drops dramatically with distance, so the source would have to be fairly close to the device(s) being powered.

Although it doesn't require direct skin-to-skin contact for the transmitter, so you could keep that in your pocket or, if small enough, hanging around your neck.

It'll be a while before we see skin-powered AirPods, if at all. But, in the shorter term the tech has some interesting applications for smart health monitoring.

For example, the researchers describe a skin-powered health patch that could potentially stay on its wearer forever. And, if it could be included in a smart ring , that could seriously reduce the need for a thick casing, one of the visible drawbacks of devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Ring."

If you've got an older iPhone and are prone to FOMO — that's the fear of missing out for us olds — the arrival of Apple Intelligence via updates to iOS 18 must feel like a trying moment. Maybe you weren't considering an upgrade to the best iPhones before, but all the chatter around Apple's suite of AI tools has you wondering if you might be passing up an opportunity to really improve your iPhone experience.

As I said when evaluating Apple Intelligence in the wake of the iOS 18.1 release, I don't think the initial batch of AI features alone should prompt a rush of iPhone 16 upgrades, though that's more about the strength of the phones themselves than a judgment on what Apple Intelligence delivers. All of the iPhone 16 models benefit from performance improvements, longer-lasting batteries and design flourishes like the Camera Capture button; the iPhone 16 Pro models in particular benefit from improved camera hardware. That's the reason to upgrade, not because Apple Intelligence can now fine-tune your emails via the Writing Tools feature.

It's also worth remembering that Apple Intelligence's arrival will be an ongoing process, as evidenced by the fact that iOS 18.1 arrived just a couple of weeks ago, and we're already packing the new additions appearing in the just-released iOS 18.2 beta. If you're not sure about an iPhone upgrade this year, just wait — Apple Intelligence will still be there, and in better shape, when you are ready to get that new iPhone.

Still, the feeling that you're missing out on something can be a powerful motivator. So if you're still on the fence about getting a new iPhone and Apple Intelligence is the one factor that could push you into the upgrade column, here are the three reasons why it makes sense to ditch that older phone for a newer model that supports Apple Intelligence.

You spend a lot of time working with images on your phone

Clean Up tool in Photos app running on ios 18.1

If you find yourself firing up the Photos app a lot — either because photography is a hobby, a side hustle or even how your bread and butter — Apple Intelligence has a lot to offer you. The Clean Up tool in Photos puts a new AI-powered editing feature at your disposal, letting you remove distracting objects or stray people from a photo with a tap. My colleague John Velasco put together a Clean Up vs. Magic Eraser face-off, and while Google's editing tool has been around for several years, Clean Up has made a promising debut. Certainly, it's a very intuitive photo-editing tool that really seems to understand what you're trying to remove from an image.

You'll also find Photos an easier app to navigate with Apple Intelligence, and I'm not just talking about the redesign Apple introduced for anyone who upgrades to iOS 18 (a redesign that I've grown to appreciate, by the way). Searching in Photos is vastly improved, as Apple now supports natural language search. Just type a description of the images you're looking for, and the odds are pretty good that it will turn up in the search results.

iOS 18.2 adds other imaging tools, including the Image Playground and Genmoji. With both features, you're using text prompts to generate images, whether it's a new avatar for one of your contacts or an emoji that you can use in Messages. You've got to request early access to Image Playground, and as of this writing, there's a multi-day wait ahead of you when you do make your request. But the image creation tools available available on your iPhone are expanding rapidly, and I can understand wanting to get in on the ground floor of that.

Serious Mail time-savers

A summary of an email in Apple Intelligence on an iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 18.1

Outside of Photos, no app on your iPhone has seen a greater Apple Intelligence-driven improvement than Apple's own Mail client. If Mail is your go-to app for staying in touch and getting things done, there's a lot to like in the updated version.

We'll start with the fact that a priority mail feature floats your most important messages to top of the inbox These are messages with a deadline or call to action, and the new Mail app wants to make sure you act on them in a timely fashion. If you struggle to stay on top of your inbox, this will go a long way toward making sure you're responding to key messages.

Summary features turn out to be a real time-saver, too, whether it's the auto-generated summaries that appear in some messages in your inbox to give you the gist of what an email is about before you tap on it, or the summary tool that parses messages to highlight their key points. I especially like the latter, too, because it helps me sort through long email chains with multiple recipients weighing in. I can just summarize the entire string of message into a couple of key sentences that break down what's been discussed, without having to peruse every single message.

iOS 18.2 introduces a new organization to Mail as well, splitting your inbox into different categories for primary mail, receipts and transactions, newsletters and promotions. (Note that this change isn't Apple Intelligence-specific.) I've just started using iOS 18.2 so I don't yet have a verdict on these changes, but they do seem to fall in line with the other productivity improvements Apple Intelligence has introduced so far.

You want a better Siri

Gif animation of new Siri with Apple Intelligence animation.

Apple has big plans for Siri, as it uses Apple Intelligence to make its digital assistant smarter and more responsive. Eventually, the plan is for Siri to be aware of what's on your iPhone screen, put that information in context and form responses based on that information — but we're a long way from that, as Mark Spoonauer's new Siri vs. old Siri testing indicates.

Of all the features I tested while putting iOS 18.1 through its paces, Siri has the most work ahead of it. iOS 18.2 looks like a crucial step forward by adding ChatGPT integration to Apple's digital assistant, which at the very least, has enhanced the conversational capabilities of Siri, according to my colleagues who've spent more time with this feature.

I turn to Siri for the basics at the moment, but if you're more heavily invested in the digital assistant's evolution into a more powerful part of the iPhone experience, you'll likely want to be a part of that progress. And that could be reason enough for you to get an iPhone that's capable of supporting the Apple Intelligence-powered version of Siri.

Quick Summary

There are already a number of new features for Apple TV with tvOS 18, including InSight and Enhance Dialogue.

But, the public beta for tvOS 18.2 has been released, bringing support for different aspect ratios which'll suit projectors, especially.

Software updates are great. Sometimes they only fix bugs and help with performance issues, while other times they add a range of new features to your devices, making them feel brand new.

Apple has released several software updates over the last couple of weeks, with iPhones, iPads and Macs all getting access to the initial phase of Apple Intelligence features, with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. However, the company has also started to release public betas of the next build of software for all those devices.

It isn't just iPhone, iPad and Mac that will benefit when next build of software arrives in its final release form – Apple TV owners will too. Just like iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, the first release of tvOS 18 didn't have all the features Apple announced during its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.

Several arrived, including Insight, that displays information about actors, characters and music on the screen, Enhance Dialogue that uses machine learning for better vocal clarity, and subtitles appearing automatically when you press mute. But, Apple also announced support for different aspect ratios during WWDC and that didn't appear in the first release of tvOS 18.

It is in the public beta of tvOS 18.2 however, and there's several on offer.

What is coming with tvOS 18.2?

When tvOS 18.2 fully arrives, you will be able to choose between Automatic, 16:9, 21:9, 2.37:1. 2.39:1, 2.40:1. DCI 4K and 32:9. Most TVs are 16:9 but as 9to5Mac points out, if you're a home cinema enthusiast who connects your Apple TV to a projector, the support for different aspect ratios allows you to pick the one best suited to your projector screen.

You'll find the aspect ratio options in your Apple TV's Audio and Video settings in the tvOS 18.2 public beta now. Or if you'd rather wait for a more stable final build, that arrives in December.

December is also when localised Apple Intelligence for the UK is set to arrive on iPhone, iPad and Mac, negating the need to set those devices to US English like you currently have to do to get access to the Apple's AI features.

We suppose then, Santa is bringing us software for our pressies this year. Let's just you're not on the naughty list or there will be no screen aspect ratio options for you."

Apple plans to use its own Apple Silicon processors for its AI servers, which will be used, among other things, to power its Apple Intelligence services in the data center, reports Nikkei. The company has approached Foxconn and Lenovo to build the machines and has specifically asked them to make the servers in Taiwan. While one of Apple's reasons for assembling these machines in Taiwan is to reduce its reliance on China, another is to tap into the talent and R&D resources that Foxconn leverages for its Nvidia-based AI servers.

Apple is exploring the production of AI servers in Taiwan at Foxconn's facilities to bolster its computing abilities for new generative AI features across its devices. However, Foxconn, Apple's primary manufacturing partner, also happens to be the world's largest maker of AI servers, primarily making machines based on Nvidia's GPUs, such as the H100 and H200. For now, Foxconn's capacity in Taiwan is fairly limited, as the company is gearing up to start volume production of GB200-based machines featuring the Blackwell architecture. This is reportedly one of the reasons why Apple wants to produce its AI machines in Taiwan: to leverage the experience that Foxconn has gained while working on Nvidia projects.

""One of the reasons Apple wants Foxconn to make servers in Taiwan is its hope to tap into the engineering talent and R&D resources that work on Nvidia projects,"" a source with knowledge of the matter told Nikkei. Neither Apple nor Foxconn commented on the report.

Apple's AI approach differs from that of cloud service providers like Microsoft and Amazon, as it focuses more on AI inference rather than training large-scale language models. Therefore, Apple will not need servers with sophisticated technologies like liquid cooling. Also, since Apple's AI servers are intended for internal use, the scale of production will be relatively small compared to Nvidia’s GB200 AI machines. That poses a problem, too, as companies like Foxconn and Lenovo prefer clients with large orders. Still, as Apple rolls out its Apple Intelligence service to more users, it is going to need more AI servers, so it remains a lucrative client.

Apple's experience in data center server design lags behind that of Nvidia, so it is seeking support from suppliers for engineering and design services. On the other hand, Apple's servers are not as sophisticated as Nvidia's GB200 machines, so the development and validation process should be relatively quick.

Developing AI server infrastructure is crucial for Apple's next-generation products, as the company tries to keep up with competitors like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, all of which are significantly expanding their AI server investments.

Due to limited capacity at Foxconn in Taiwan, Apple is also in talks with Lenovo and its subsidiary LCFC to assist with server designs. To diversify and mitigate reliance on Chinese suppliers, Apple and Lenovo are discussing additional production capabilities outside of China. Smaller suppliers like Universal Scientific Industrial are also considered to support production.

Foxconn operates AI labs in Hsinchu, Taiwan, and San Jose, California, where it works closely with Nvidia to develop the next generation of servers, dubbed the GB300, the report says."

Apple's big week of Mac announcements has brought a new , a redesigned , and a refreshed line of . Powering them all is the new M4 chip, along with the M4 Pro and M4 Max. But if you bought a new Mac last year or this year, you may be facing a dilemma: Is it worth upgrading from the recent M3-powered Macs to the new M4 models?

How Big of a Deal Is Apple M4?

What does the new M4 processor bring to the table? Comparing the base M4 with the previous M3 chip, you can see several notable changes.

For starters, the M4 chip has 28 billion transistors, a 12% increase from the M3's 25 billion. That change should directly translate to better performance and energy efficiency. The new chip enhances the faster performance cores with improvements to the architecture and instruction set, while also expanding the core configuration.

The GPU gets a boost with extra graphics cores, and the memory support is improved with 120GBps bandwidth and the addition of LPDDR5X memory support. The Neural Engine also receives a boost, capable of 38 trillion operations per second—double the M3’s speed—ideal for advanced AI tasks in creative software.

We do have a deeper dive , but here's the gist: The spec-for-spec comparison shows plenty of incremental improvements to nearly every part of the chip. But do all of those changes justify upgrading if you had your M3 Mac for less than a year?

While it's difficult to make any firm claims about performance without having actually tested the new Macs yet, we can look at Apple's own reported improvements. In the press releases for the recent new iMac, Apple claims that the M4 delivers:

1.7x faster performance in apps like Microsoft Excel

1.5x faster browsing in Safari

2x higher frame rates

2.1x faster photo and video editing when applying complex filters and effects in Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro

But, here's the catch: These improvements apply when comparing the new M4 iMac to the older , which uses the M1 chip. That's a three-generation difference. What about comparing the M4 with the recent M3's performance? Here, Apple doesn't say much, but it did share two performance comparison charts during the announcement video for the new iMac.

The first compares Excel performance:

Obviously, this chart is extremely light on details. It would help a lot to know what ""Productivity in Excel"" actually means, whether that's measuring the speed of certain actions, the performance in specific complex actions, or the handling of very large datasets. Without any of that detail, the whole claim is pretty vague.

What it says clearly is that the M4 chip is ""1.3x faster"" than the prior M3 processor. That's another way to say that the M4 offers a 30% improvement. Impressive, but not the giant leap seen when comparing with the M1.

The second comparison focuses on GPU performance:

Again, the lack of context is an obvious problem when evaluating any claim. But in this case, we know that the M4 chip is bringing to bear a new 10-core GPU with amped-up ray-tracing acceleration and an improved scheduler handling the task allocation and execution.

But those enhancements only net a 10% improvement over the M3's GPU. Again, nothing to sneeze at—10% performance gains year over year are actually quite impressive—but nothing like the 2x improvement over the older M1.

In the end, it doesn't actually look like M4 is a huge improvement over M3. It is faster, and making the switch will result in measurable improvements—we'll see how much when we get the new Macs in to test—but even looking at Apple's claims, I don't see the improvements being compelling enough for the average user to pay more.

Exception One: Apple Intelligence

That said, there is one compelling reason to switch to M4, even if you upgraded to M3 already: .

New features are already available on older systems and versions of macOS, but the real improvements will be derived from the M4 chip's improved neural engine and the 38 TOPS it delivers. Every other aspect of the M4 chip is offering a marginal improvement over the M3, delivering an incremental boost that's not quite enough to justify upgrading if you bought a new Mac in the last year.

But the new hotness in the laptop world isn't focused on transistor counts or performance core speeds, or even GPU performance. The latest cutting-edge trend is AI.

Apple's moves in the AI space are collectively labeled ""Apple Intelligence:"" a collection of functions and features like writing tools across several key Mac apps, photo editing tools, natural language photo and video search, and a that offers in-depth technical assistance with all sorts of Apple products.

These new features are offered on any iPad or Mac with an M1 chip or better, as well as recent iPhones. What's more, these first Apple Intelligence features are just the start, with new features coming as soon as December.

But even with older models getting these same tools, the M4 chip's improved neural engine will be the hands-down best processor for all things AI on Mac. If you're aching for more AI functionality on your MacBook, the M4 chips (particularly the just-announced M4 Pro and M4 Max) are the most powerful silicon available, and the chips best suited to these new smart features.

And if you're really into the latest AI advancements, above and beyond Apple Intelligence, running local LLMs and other AI models will also see a dramatic improvement on the higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max, where memory bandwidth climbs even higher. Even the compact Mac mini can be outfitted with up to 64GB of RAM.

Exception Two: Stepping Up a Tier or Two

All of this also assumes that you're looking at a one-to-one upgrade. Going from M3 to M4 is one thing, but going from M3 to an M4 Pro or M4 Max will be a very different discussion. The more powerful M4 variants will, naturally, offer bigger performance and speed gains, as well as the higher expense that comes with the beefier chips. If that's an upgrade you're considering, then go for it.

The same goes for upgrading after more than one generation. If you're still rocking an M1 iMac or MacBook Pro, or even the M2 Mac mini or MacBook Air, then now is actually a great time to upgrade, because the newest processing hardware will give you a real boost in speed and capability.

Got an M3 Mac? You Should Probably Wait for M5

But in the final analysis, unless you're really jazzed about Apple Intelligence or looking to bump up from a basic CPU to something more advanced, I'm pretty comfortable telling you to hang onto the Mac you've got. If you're already using an M3 processor, the cost of upgrading isn't worth the expense, and you can easily get another year of great performance from your Apple desktop or laptop without it ever being noticeably slower than the latest model."

Apple makes many iconic products, but the MacBook probably takes the cake when it comes to traditional computers.

And this year, the MacBook Pro took the accomplishments even further: thanks to a new M4 chip, the MacBook may actually take back the crown for the best battery life of any laptop money can buy right now, eclipsing even Dell's XPS 13.

But for all the fanfare about the new MacBook Pros, it wasn't Apple's perennially high-achieving laptop that really caught my attention. Sometimes it's not the biggest product that makes a splash — it's the mini ones.

Small, but mighty

Apple mac mini power button

If you didn't get the hint, I'm talking about the Mac mini.

Apple's Mac mini might not always be the star of Apple's show, but it made a major leap this year. Like the rest of Apple's lineup, the Mac mini got an M4 upgrade, which is significant given that the last iteration used the M2 — aka two generations behind the current chips.

While that upgrade means many things, the short of it is that the Mac mini will be much more capable when it comes to running compute-intensive creative apps and much better at handling any task involving AI thanks to its Neural Engine upgrade. According to Apple, the M4 Pro variant of the Mac mini has a neural engine that's three times faster than the M1.

What's wild isn't just that the Mac mini is faster; it's that it's much faster than its predecessor while also being much, much smaller. The M4 Mac mini is just 5 x 5 inches, which is small even without context, but it looks so much smaller when compared to the last iteration.

In fact, the M4 Mac mini is small enough that I might even call it a portable desktop. Sure, it's not quite pocketable, but tossing this thing into a backpack seems like it should be no problem.

If it feels like I'm gushing, I am, but that's not even the best part.

Apple goes affordable

If you asked most people to describe Apple products in one word, ""affordable"" would very rarely, if ever, top the list.

While $600 might not be outright ""affordable,"" when you consider how much Apple is providing for that amount of money—and compare the M4 Mac mini against similarly priced PCs—that price tag starts to feel like a steal.

Even when compared to Apple's own product lineup, the M4 Mac mini feels like an unbeatable value. A 15-inch M3 MacBook, for example, costs a minimum of $1,299.

We'll have to wait and see just how the Mac mini performs, but as noted by Laptop Mag editor Rami Tabari, the prospects look good:

""On the Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm benchmark, the M1 Mac mini scored 31.5 frames per second, which is just playable. The M4 Mac mini could score 69.3 fps, which surpasses the 60-fps golden standard in gaming. Again, that surpasses the M3 MacBook Pro (51 fps) and the M3 Pro MacBook Pro (53.7 fps).""

And even more exciting than the M4 Mac mini is what it could say about the future of Apple's lineup.

Same luxury, more value

For some tech companies, a value-oriented gadget might not seem like a big deal, but we're talking about Apple — a company whose name is basically synonymous with ""premium"" in the dollar amount sense.

Of course, this isn't the first time Apple has positioned the Mac mini as a budget-friendly option — this year's version is only $100 more expensive than the previous generation — but it does show Apple's interest in and commitment to more accessible gadgets.

Whether that ethos will translate to other gadgets remains to be seen, but with rumors of an upcoming iPhone SE, Apple might broaden its scope to capture more budget-focused audiences.

And even if Apple doesn't do that, the Mac mini still stands as an exceptionally enticing deal upgrade in Apple's product lineup. Think about it: In a sea of iterative updates, the M4 Mac Mini does everything you could want in an upgrade.

A Mac Mini in front of an iMac display with a black background

It's much more compact while vastly increasing performance and only raises the previous retail price by $100. A big part of how substantive the upgrade feels has almost nothing to do with tech or engineering.

Unlike other products like the iPhone, the Mac mini hasn't been upgraded in two years, which obviously gives more room for growth and extra time to make substantive advancements.

With a little more patience, could we see the same kind of exciting upgrade with the iPhone? Maybe, just maybe. Here's to hoping the Mac mini sets the tone for Apple products."

Just over 43 years ago, the dawn of a new era started when IBM launched the first true personal computer, the 5150 which I fondly remember by its moniker, IBM PC.

The recent new Mac Mini announcement came as part of a bland, plain text Apple press release a few days ago, but I believe that it is a huge milestone for the Cupertino-based company, a philosophical pinnacle that will change the perspective of Apple skeptics (like me).

Without bumping its base price ($599, $499 for students), Apple shrunk the Mac Mini to the popular 5-inch x 5-inch form factor, commonly adopted by gazillions of Mini PCs.

It is the smallest Apple PC ever, it is the first one without the quasi-obsolete USB Type-A port, it is the cheapest PC that supports any sort of AI (Apple Intelligence) or comes with Thunderbolt 4 connectors.

It is also the most affordable (or smallest) PC I know that can drive three monitors with a combined 55,461,888 pixels (a pair of 6K monitors and one 5K display); that’s enough grunt to power six, yes six, 4K screens.

Outstanding performance for the price

As for the M4, it delivers the fastest processor performance in this price range; there’s no photo finish, especially for single-threaded tasks. I checked it against the Core i5-14400 (as found in the Dell Inspiron PC), the Core i7-13620H, and even the mighty Ryzen 9 7940HS, using the public test database compiled by CPU Benchmark test.

The 2024 Apple Mac Mini is not perfect though, with its biggest bugbear being the puny 256GB storage the entry level model comes from; I can live with that. Like the original IBM PC, it has hit a sweet spot, a Goldilocks balance between pricing and features that finally brings to Apple the final feather to crown the Mac Mini as the perfect PC; value for money.

Apple is now affordable, good value, accessible, for the masses, and friendly even. Is it time to say goodbye to the Windows PC? Perhaps but it depends on who you are. The new Mac Mini covers a lot of bases but it is the entry level model that captures my imagination; increasing the memory by 50% and doubling the storage, which costs about $20 in parts, adds another $400 to the price tag.

This is where PCs have and will continue to differentiate themselves from Apple offerings by offering more choices with lower margins (and therefore keener prices). With each new generation of devices though, Apple makes life a little bit more difficult for PC vendors like Dell or HP.

The Apple Mac Mini currently tops our best Mini PC list and its new iteration only cements its position there. And I may well have found my perfect Christmas gift; only need to make sure I’ve been on the nice list for Santa Claus.

Apple's yearly silicon upgrade — the M4 chip — made waves with its debut in the iPad Pro back in mid-May. It's the first time we've ever seen Apple's proprietary chip launch in an iPad rather than a MacBook, and despite some iPad Pro-related limitations, the M4 chip has impressed both critics and consumers.

Now that Apple has officially launched the M4 MacBook Pro lineup, people are understandably wondering: ""Should I stick with my M3 MacBook Pro or upgrade to an M4 MacBook Pro?"" Or, if you're a new buyer, is it worth searching out a new M4 model over an M3 model?

The M4 chip is objectively a better chip compared to the M3, but are the upgrades enough to justify spending top dollar on an M4 MacBook over a possibly discounted M3 MacBook? We'll help you figure that out by comparing the two chips by their specs, performance and AI capabilities, and availability. Let's get into it.

M4 vs. M3: Price and availability

Overall, Apple's M4 lineup is much bigger than its M3 lineup. That's all thanks to the M4 chip upgrade gracing Apple's iPad Pro and Mac Mini, both of which made the jump from M2 to M4, skipping over the M3 chip entirely.

From past experience, we know the M4 chip will come to the MacBook Air eventually, but as Apple's budget-friendly laptop, it likely won't be until sometime next year.

It's worth noting the lack of Apple's M3 Ultra and M4 Ultra chips in the table above. If Apple was going to launch an M3 Ultra chip, the company likely would have done so at WWDC 2024. Because WWDC 2024 came and went with no M3 Ultra announcement, and the company has now announced M4 chips for its lineup, it's safe to assume there will be no M3 Ultra variant.

But what about the M4 Ultra? Well, there's still a good chance Apple could launch an ultra-powerful M4 variant, but it probably wouldn't launch until at least WWDC 2025 in June.

Looking to the present, here are the M4 devices you can currently order:

All of the devices listed above have the same starting price as their last-gen, M3-powered counterparts, with three exceptions. The M4 Pro Mac Mini costs $100 more than the M3 Pro Mac Mini, and both the 11-inch and 13-inch M4 iPad Pro models costs $200 more than their M2-powered predecessors.

Although Apple is only selling new, M4-powered devices at full price, many retailers still have M3-powered devices in stock — often at a discount. At the time of writing, you can save up to $800 on an M2 iPad Pro, save up to $500 on an M3 MacBook Pro, or save $150 on an M2 Mac mini or M3 iMac.

Although buying an M4 device over an older M2 or M3 device seems like a no-brainer at the same or similar starting prices, it gets a bit trickier when you throw major discounts into the mix. So let's take a look at each chip's makeup to see how much more power you get with the M4 chip over the M3, and whether it's worth the price difference.

M4 vs. M3: Architecture

Both the M4 chip and the M3 chip use the 3-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process, though the M4 chip is built using the slightly improved, second-gen version. The changes made between these two chips on paper are fairly minimal, but performance-wise, it should make a noticeable difference.

The M4 chip found in the iPad Pro offers either 3 or 4 performance cores paired with 6 efficiency cores, but the lower-end M4 with a 9-core CPU will only be available in the iPad Pro. All other devices will start with a 10-core CPU variant of the M4 chip, which should mean extended battery life for each applicable device, as we've seen with the iPad Pro.

Compared to the M3 chip, the M4 chip has an extra 3 billion transistors and more memory bandwidth, great for faster processing speeds. For most devices, it also has a higher max memory capacity than the M3 chip. The only exception here is the iPad Pro, which has a max memory capacity of 16GB due to its own limitations.

Apple also improved on the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips' architecture, though it looks like the M4 Pro chip got a slightly larger upgrade than the M4 Max.

The company did away with the lower-end, 11-core CPU option in the M3 Pro and instead made a 12-core CPU the base for the M4 Pro. Now, you can choose between a 12-core CPU or a 14-core CPU, to be paired with a 16-core or 20-core GPU, respectively.

Furthermore, the M4 Pro chip has a higher max memory capacity of 64GB, up almost double from the M3 Pro chip's max memory capacity of 36GB, and more memory bandwidth: 273GB/s versus the M3 Pro's 150GB/s.

The M4 Max chip shares quite a bit with the M3 Max, like a max memory capacity of 128GB and a choice between a 14- or 16-core CPU with identical splits between performance and efficiency cores.

Here are the slight differences. First, the base GPU cores got a slight bump from 30 with the M3 Max to 32 with the M4 Max. Then, the M4 Max chip's memory bandwidth of 546GB/s trumps the M3 Max chip's memory bandwidth of 400GB/s.

Apple has yet to reveal the number of transistors on the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, but it's undoubtedly a much higher number than the number of transistors on the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.

If the ratio of transistors to the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips is applied to the M4 chip lineup, then the M4 Pro should have about 41 billion transistors and the M4 Max should have about 103 billion transistors.

With the technical specs out of the way, let's take a look at how they translate into real-world performance.

M4 vs. M3: Performance

When the M4 chip initially debuted, Apple had plenty of comparisons to the M2 chip, as that's the chip that was in the previous iPad Pro model. The M4 chip boasts a CPU that's up to ""50% faster"" than the M2 chip, and a GPU that's up to ""4x faster.""

Apple M4 spec sheet

As far as how the M4 lineup compares to the M3 lineup, it's still a bit up in the air. MacBook Pro models with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips officially launch on November 8. Until we get closer to that release date, we probably won't see many, if any, Geekbench 6 scores for these new chips.

For right now, the only rumored performance gauge we have to go off of comes from a Russian outlet that got their hands on an M4 MacBook Pro. The outlet found the M4 MacBook Pro to be about 25% faster than the M3 MacBook Pro, with a wildly impressive Geekbench 6 multi-core score of 15,228.

That's slightly higher than the Geekbench 6 multi-core score our sister site got from their iPad Pro M4 review unit: 14,523. And it's much higher than the multi-core score we saw in our MacBook Pro 14 M3 review: 11,870.

In the Tom's Guide review of an M3 Pro MacBook Pro, the 14-inch laptop earned a multi-core score of 14,357 on Geekbench 6. Then, our 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro earned a staggering multi-core score of 20,863.

Using these numbers, we can estimate that the M4 Pro may achieve a Geekbench 6 multi-core score of 18-19,000, and the M3 Max could earn an even more impressive score of 26-27,000.

When we're able to run tests on our own M4 MacBooks, we'll update this section with hands-on performance results.

M4 vs. M3: Neural engine

On paper, both the M4 and M3 chip variants are equipped with a 16-core Neural Engine, but Apple says the ""M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second.""

apple m4 neural engine

Thanks to the M4 chip's faster memory bandwidth, a better-performing GPU, and ""next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators in the CPU,"" devices with an M4 chip will be able to carry out AI-powered tasks faster and more efficiently than the M3. And luckily, we already have a few real-world tests to back that claim up.

Our sister site TechRadar ran three different Geekbench ML benchmarks on the iPad Pro M4 and an M3 MacBook, and found that the M4 chip boasted a performance increase of 32 - 46%, depending on the test. So if utilizing AI on your MacBook is important to you, it might be worth splurging on an M4 MacBook.

Outlook

Apple's M4 chip is clearly more powerful than its base M3 chip, but does the average everyday laptop user need all the power an M4 chip promises? Probably not, but hear me out.

If you already have an M3-powered MacBook or iMac and it's not giving you any issues, there's probably no reason to upgrade — unless you want to be able to play graphically-intensive games, edit lengthy videos, mess around with 3D rendering, or have any additional needs that you didn't have when you first purchased your M3 MacBook.

If you're buying a MacBook (or another Apple device) for the first time, I'd say it's worth the splurge for the best performance possible. On top of wildly impressive performance and strong on-device AI capabilities, M4 MacBooks will likely have incredible battery life.

That said, I'm a sucker for a great deal, and there's a chance we could see some stellar deals in the near future for M2- and M3-powered Apple devices being replaced by a newer, M4-powered model. If you only need a laptop with a great battery life or a tiny desktop to carry out simple tasks, you absolutely can't go wrong buying a discounted last-gen device."

(Fortunately for Apple, it just so happens to coincide with its earnings call on Thursday!) The company’s three-day product rollout for desktop hardware centered around the M4 chip, built for Apple Intelligence. We recount everything Apple spit out this week, including a new iMac, Mac mini, MacBook Pro and other goodies like Apple Intelligence’s official arrival on iOS, iPadOS and macOS.

iMac (M4)

The M4-powered iMac has the same design (apart from some new colors) but with more horsepower inside. Apple says the all-in-one desktop is 1.7 times faster for daily productivity and 2.1 times faster for more demanding tasks like gaming or photo editing. Like all new Macs announced this week, it loses the measly 8GB of RAM previously seen in the cheapest Macs, jumping to 16GB as the baseline. (Woo!)

The new iMac still has a 24-inch 4.5K Retina display encased in an aluminum unibody design. However, it adds a new nano-texture glass screen option for reduced glare and a 12MP Center Stage camera that supports Apple’s Desk View.

You can pre-order the M4 iMac now, starting at $1,299. Deliveries and in-store sales begin on November 8.

Mac mini (M4, M4 Pro)

Apple’s little Mac that could lives up to its “mini” branding more than ever. The 2024 Mac mini is a mere five-inch by five-inch box, two inches tall. (That’s only slightly bigger than the Apple TV 4K!)

The new Mac mini is available in M4 and M4 Pro configurations. Apple says the M4 variant is up to 1.8 times faster than the M1 model from four years ago. Its graphics are up to 2.2 times faster. It should also be much better for Apple Intelligence: It supports 38 TOPS (tera operations per second) of AI processing power. That dwarfs the 18 TOPS from the (only one-year-old) M3 chip. It, too, starts with 16GB of RAM.

For the first time, the machine ditches legacy USB ports. It has two USB-C ports on the front and three Thunderbolt USB-C ports on the back (along with HDMI and Ethernet).

The M4 Mac mini is available to pre-order. It starts at $599, while the souped-up M4 Pro variant starts at $1,399. It arrives on November 9.

MacBook Pro (M4, M4 Pro, M4 Max)

Most of Apple’s Mac sales are in the MacBook lineup, which makes sense. Not only can you use them on the go, but you can also grab a Thunderbolt cable and hook them up to the monitor of your choice to double as a desktop. So, the climax of Mac Week was the new M4-powered MacBook Pro.

The only new Mac with three chip tiers, the MacBook Pro comes in M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max options. Apple says the M4 Pro is up to three times faster than the M1 Pro, and the M4 Max is up to 3.5 times faster than the M1 Max. The M4 variant is up to 1.8 times faster than the M1-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro for photo editing. That jumps to 3.4 times faster for demanding work like rendering scenes in Blender.

Its Neural Engine for Apple Intelligence (and other AI) is over three times as powerful as the M1. Helping out on the AI front (and for all-around performance) is the same 16GB of RAM as a baseline.

The laptop offers the same nano-texture display option as the iMac and up to 1,000 nits of brightness for SDR content. It also adopts the 12MP Center Stage camera for much better built-in video call capabilities. The device has three Thunderbolt 4 ports and an estimated 24 hours of battery life — as Apple puts it, that’s the longest ever in a Mac.

The new MacBook Pro is available in familiar 14-inch and 16-inch models. The smaller model with the M4 chip starts at $1,599, the M4 Pro variant starts at $1,999, and the ultra-high-end M4 Max will set you back at least $3,199. The 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,499 with the M4 Pro chip, while an M4 Max flavor is $3,499 and up.

Apple Intelligence cometh

Apple’s first wave of on-device AI features is now in consumers’ hands, with no beta software required. This round includes writing tools like proofreading, rewiring and summaries, live call transcriptions and notification summaries.

The beginnings of a more intelligent Siri also arrived with this batch, including typed queries and an improved ability to recognize stutters or self-interruptions. You also get a neat new glowing border that announces to the world, “This ain’t the shitty Siri you’re used to!” But you’ll have to wait for the next wave of Siri upgrades for a more significant overhaul, like a better understanding of personal context.

Now, the bad news. Apple Intelligence is only available on a handful of recent devices in each of Apple’s major product categories. For the iPhone, that’s the iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max and the new iPhone 16 lineup (including non-Pro models). You’ll need a model with an M-series chip on the iPad, although the new iPad mini (with an A17 Pro chip) is an exception. As for Macs, you’ll also need a model with M-series Apple silicon, which stretches back to the last four years of models.

Apple Intelligence (round one) requires iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 or macOS Sequoia 15.1. The X.2 variants of each OS will bring the next wave of AI features, like ChatGPT integration and Image Playground.

AirPods Pro 2 hearing features

Not to be missed among the higher-profile announcements is a new series of hearing health tools for AirPods Pro 2 owners.

Announced at Apple’s September iPhone launch, the hearing features include a “clinically validated” hearing test, hearing protection (like for concerts) and the ability to use the device as a hearing aid if it detects mild to moderate impairment. (If severe, it will nudge you towards a professional.)

Engadget’s audio guru, Billy Steele, is the person to follow for more on these features. He’s extensively trialed them, including taking hearing tests with an Apple rep and test-driving AirPods-powered hearing protection at concerts."

After months of being teased with Apple Intelligence features, iOS 18.1 will finally be released on October 28. It includes a few neat tools like Clean Up in the Photos app and a slightly enhanced Siri. However, if you're itching to get even more Apple Intelligence features, you can.

On Wednesday, Apple launched the iOS 18.2 developer beta 1, which is packed with some of the AI-powered features we've been most excited about. Here's a brief look at Apple Intelligence features currently available via the iOS 18.2 dev beta.

Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.2 beta 1

It looks like iOS 18.2 is packed with fun image generation features, easily making it the most exciting update for those with an iPhone 16 series or a Pro-model iPhone 15.

First up, there's Image Playground. According to Apple, this dedicated app will allow you ""create fun images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch."" It'll also be available as a tool within other apps, like Messages.

With iOS 18.2, users can play around with creating personalized Genmojis via simple text prompts. You can add these neat emojis in Messages, or use them as stickers or as a reaction in a Tapback.

In the Notes app, Apple will also be adding the Image Wand feature to the Apple Pencil's tool palette. According to Apple, ""Rough sketches can be turned into delightful images, and users can even select empty space to create an image using context from the surrounding area.""

While image generation is perhaps more exciting, the most notable update attached to iOS 18.2 is ChatGPT integration. This'll make Siri much smarter and able to respond faster and better to complex questions and tasks. iOS 18.2 also integrates ChatGPT with Writing Tools, which will allow for a new 'Compose' option that uses generative AI to create text for you.

iOS 18.2 also introduces Visual Intelligence. Similar to how Google Lens works, Visual Intelligence will allow users to identify and learn more about whatever they're taking a photo of, even asking ChatGPT for specific questions related to what's in the photo.

Finally, Apple is expanding support for Apple Intelligence to more regions via iOS 18.2. These AI-powered features will be available in English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.

How to download the iOS 18.2 developer beta 1

It's possible to download the iOS 18.1 developer beta 3 as a non-developer and grab new Apple Intelligence features as long as you've registered with Apple's developer website and you have one of the following phones:

iPhone 15 Pro

iPhone 15 Pro Max

iPhone 16

iPhone 16 Plus

iPhone 16 Pro

iPhone 16 Pro Max

However, doing so isn't recommended if you're an end user and your iPhone is your only phone. If you meet the requirements mentioned above, here's how to download the iOS 18.2 beta 1:

1. Launch your iPhone's Settings app.

2. Head to General, and then Software.

3. Select Software Update > Beta Updates. If you spot the iOS 18.2 beta 1, download and install it.

Otherwise, you'll only have to wait until Monday to download the public release of iOS 18.1, which comes with some Apple Intelligence features, like Clean Up in Photos, AI summaries within many apps, and an enhanced version of Siri."

It was widely expected that Apple would reveal desktop Macs and MacBooks that run on M4 chipsets next week, a year after the company unveiled its first M3-powered laptops. The M4 debuted in an iPad Pro earlier this year, but Apple has yet to refresh its Macs with the chipset. It had long been rumored that Apple would release M4-powered iMacs, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros and a redesigned Mac mini by early 2025, and now it appears to be doing so ahead of the peak holiday shopping season.

New hardware isn't the only thing Apple has lined up for next week. On Monday, the company will release iPhone, iPad and Mac software updates that will give the masses their first taste of Apple Intelligence features. Meanwhile, Apple just released its latest iPad Mini."

In a press release spotted by The Verge, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said it was fining the two companies a combined $89 million over practices involving the Apple Card.

The CFPB says Apple failed to send “tens of thousands” of disputed card transactions to Goldman Sachs. When it finally sent the transactions to the investment bank, Goldman Sachs failed to follow “numerous federal requirements for investigating the disputes,” according to the CFPB’s announcement.

Apple and Goldman are also accused of misleading customers about the Apple Card. Some consumers believed they could make interest-free payments to purchase an Apple device with the credit card but interest charges still showed up on their bill “because they were not automatically enrolled as expected.”

Apple is also accused of keeping its interest-free payment option off of its website if the customer wasn’t using a Safari browser. The CFPB also says Goldman Sachs misled customers about the application of some refunds that racked up additional interest charges.

The CFPB has ordered Goldman Sachs to pay at least $19.8 million in redress funds and a $45 million civil money penalty. The company is also required to present a “credible plan” to comply with laws before launching any new credit card product. Apple also received a $25 million civil money penalty that will go to the CFPB’s victims relief fund.

Apple and Goldman Sachs introduced the Apple Card in 2019, advertising it as a product that could “help customers lead a healthier financial life.”. Four years later, a report from the Wall Street Journal said that Goldman Sachs was starting to have doubts about the consumer lending industry and thought the venture may have been a mistake."

New reports suggest that Apple could cease production of its Vision Pro mixed reality headset by the end of the year following lacklustre sales. The virtual and augmented reality headset, which allows users to create a private 100-foot cinema screen, has reportedly been met with a lukewarm reaction and underwhelming sales figures due to its high price tag and limited content offering.

Despite it launching outside of the US only earlier this year, the Vision Pro – which retails for £3499 / $3499 / AU$5999 – was billed as a revolutionary venture in Apple's product portfolio when it was announced in 2023, and it caught our interest thanks to its immersive movie watching capabilities. It was anticipated to bring a greater sense of immersion to the movie-watching experience, while also acting as a private home cinema that could be taken on the go. Its Micro-OLED displays (one for each eye) are also primed for movie watching, while Spatial Audio via AirPods should complete the immersive package when it comes to cinematic sound.

Just a year on, Apple has reportedly told manufacturers to scale back production greatly, which could indicate that it has a sufficient number of units to sustain the current model for the rest of its expected lifespan. As reported by MacRumors, some manufacturers stopped producing components as early as May this year due to weak sales forecasts. Apple has also supposedly informed Luxshare, which assembles the Vision Pro headsets in China, that it could be required to ""wind down production"" by November of this year; for reference, the company is reportedly producing 1000 Vision Pro units per day, which is half of what it was producing during peak demand.

If that doesn't spell enough trouble for the headset, further suggestions that the development of a second-generation headset is stalling also signals a troubled future for the Vision Pro. Instead, Apple is possibly looking at options to develop a cheaper headset in the meantime, suspending plans for a true replacement to the Vision Pro for at least a year. MacRumors suggests that Apple might release a small specification-bump version of the Vision Pro with an upgraded processor while retaining the current design in order to use up a backlog of manufactured parts if it does decide to update the headset.

So what does this mean for VR and AR in the world of home cinema? While a new dimension of immersive movie watching was promised with this headset, it seems that hasn't come to fruition. Apple has just released its first scripted piece of content exclusively for the Vision Pro, titled Submerged, which has been met with positive reviews. This is over a year after the Vision Pro's release, however, so it feels as though it might be too little, too late. Other brands within the VR and AR space, such as Meta, appear to be gearing their headsets towards gaming and productivity rather than immersive AV experiences.

We must, of course, take these reports with a pinch of salt, as these behind-the-scenes production logistics aren't always as they seem. Apple also tends to play its cards close to its chest, so we'll wait for an official word on the future of Vision Pro before we presume it deceased.

Ah, the Magic Mouse 2. Apple isn't a company known for design fails, but we've seen a couple of clangers over the years. From last year's swiftly discontinued FineWoven accessories to the infamous MacBook butterfly keyboard debacle, Cupertino's finest doesn't always get it absolutely right. But nothing has drawn more vocal ire among users than the design of the Magic Mouse 2.

For the uninitiated, Apple's current Magic Mouse features a Lightning Port on the bottom, which means the moment it runs out of juice, it's impossible to use. Cue screams of frustration from creatives mid-way through projects. But if a new report is to be believed, Apple could be working on a new iteration of the mouse.

New code spotted by MacRumors within iOS 18.1 references a new Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. But before we get excited, it's important to note that Apple may simply be planning to add USB-C to the existing devices. Since the company was essentially strong-armed into adopting the tech by EU law, it's been steadily replacing Lightning with USB-C, and the keyboard and mouse are among the last holdouts.

But with so many complaints about the mouse for so many years, wouldn't this be a perfect moment to tweak the design so that the port is accessible during use? We can but dream. But then again, as one X user has hilariously imagined (above), Apple could make the thing even worse."

You can find some great smartwatch deals among today’s Samsung Galaxy Watch deals, Fitbit deals, and Google Pixel Watch deals, but if Apple is your brand and we’ve got you covered on today’s best Apple Watch deals. The Apple Watch Series 10 was recently released and it’s leaving some good deals on previous models in its wake, and right now Apple Watch deals are among the best Apple deals available.Reading onward you’ll find savings on nearly all of the current Apple Watch models, as well as some substantial savings on some refurbished models.

Best Apple Watch SE deals

The front of the Apple Watch SE 2.

The first-generation Apple Watch SE, which was released in 2020, and the second-generation Apple Watch SE, which was rolled out in 2022, are the most affordable ways of getting an Apple Watch. They don’t give up too much in order to keep costs low compared to their more expensive peers though. The Apple Watch SE 2, in particular, still provides comprehensive fitness tracking features, a comfortable fit, and excellent software as it can be updated to Apple’s latest watchOS 10.

Best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the top-of-the-line model of Apple’s wearable devices, featuring a beautiful titanium design, a gorgeous display, and unparalleled performance with the S9 chipset. In our Apple Watch Ultra 2 versus Apple Watch Ultra comparison, the advantages of the newer model of the smartwatch include 50% more brightness at 3,000 nits, an upgraded Neural Engine that results in more accurate speech recognition, and more fitness tracking features.

Best Apple Watch Series 9 deals

The Apple Watch Series 9 reigns over our list of the best smartwatches as our top choice for iPhone owners, as it combines extensive health, fitness, and safety features with fast, smooth, and usable performance. It’s our recommended Apple Watch for most people because it strikes a nice balance between price, features, and performance, and it’s very comfortable to wear so you won’t even notice that it’s on your wrist the whole day.

Other Apple Watch deals worth shopping

An Apple Watch Series 8 with the screen turned on.

There are many other models of the Apple Watch that are on sale across the different retailers. Older versions of the wearable device are still worthwhile purchases, as they’re still pretty quick by today’s standards, and they’re a more affordable way of joining the Apple Watch bandwagon. You need to hurry if you’re interested in any of these offers though, as stocks are already limited.

How we chose the best Apple Watch deals

The Apple Watch lineup regularly makes for some of the best Apple deals to shop. The discounts that are regularly available on pretty much all Apple Watch models can range anywhere from modest to significant, but there does seem to be quite a few Apple Watch deals to choose from at any given moment. This can make tracking down the best Apple Watch deals a little difficult, so we consider a few things to make the job of selecting the best Apple Watch deals more convenient for you.

The newest Apple Watches actually turn up some great smartwatch deals pretty regularly. They’re often scattered across retailers, but the most recent Apple Watch releases are important to keep an eye on. Right now these include the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. As well, the Apple Watch SE 2 is its most recent Special Edition release. We put a primary focus on these models when we select the best Apple Watch deals specifically because they’re new, popular, and in-demand for a discount.

But the latest and greatest isn’t what everyone’s after, and with Apple’s technology and features holding up well over time we also make a point of including some older Apple Watch models among our selections for the best Apple Watch deals. These include the original Apple Watch Ultra, as well as the original Apple Watch SE and older Apple Watch models like the Series 8 and Series 7. Sometimes we dip into the refurbished bins here, which always come with warranties and can include some of the largest savings available on an Apple Watch."

Apple has confirmed the iOS 18.1 release date to several outlets that were given early access to its new hearing health features. Earlier today, it seeded release candidate versions of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, officially concluding the beta-testing period.

iOS 18.1 will bring several hearing health features to the latest AirPods Pro 2, including hearing protection, hearing testing, and hearing aid. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Apple marketing authorization for its over-the-counter hearing aid software, turning the earbuds into a hearing aid for folks with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment.

iOS 18.1 will mark the first update since iOS 18.0 arrived in September. This is the update that will finally enable the first batch of Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone 15 Pro phones and the iPhone 16 lineup. There will be writing tools to summarize, rewrite, and proofread any text. Siri will get a new glowing animation and a new shortcut to type to Siri (double-tapping the bottom of the display). Moreover, the smart assistant will use Apple's large language model to understand more complex queries, especially if you stumble or start over.

AI will also summarize your notifications and provide contextually aware replies in apps like Messages and Mail. Photos will get natural language search and the ability to create animated slideshows from simple prompts. A Clean Up feature in Photos will remove unwanted objects from images while seamlessly replacing the background.

Other Apple Intelligence features coming in the first wave include generating transcripts of recorded phone calls, summaries of web articles in Safari, a new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions, and more. Features coming later include a substantial Siri upgrade with the ability to perform complex actions across apps, AI image generation dubbed Image Playground, creating new emoji from prompts called Genmoji, and ChatGPT integration in Siri.

If you don't care about Apple Intelligence or the new AirPods hearing health features, iOS 18.1 brings enough quality-of-life improvements to justify installing it, including a fix for sudden freezes and restarts that some iPhone 16 owners complained about.

It’s going to be packed with features and powered by the A17 Pro chip, the same one used in the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. Not only is it a highly anticipated device, but it might offer be the best bang for your buck as far as Apple Intelligence is concerned.

One of the biggest selling points of this iPad is its focus on Apple Intelligence, even if the service starts five days after the release of the iPad mini — on October 28. It won’t even be available at launch, but users will be able to access the features after an update. The biggest selling point, though, is the price. At just $349, this budget-friendly tablet is the most affordable iPad that can use Apple Intelligence at the moment — and probably the least expensive we’ll see for quite some time.

According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the main Apple Intelligence features aren’t going to be available until sometime between December and March. At first, Intelligence will only be able to summarize notifications from various apps. That’s a useful feature, but compared to one like Image Creation or Smart Reply, it kind of loses a bit of the shine.

Apple

Apple Intelligence would explain why the wait for an iPad refresh has been so long. The last time the entry-level iPad was updated was October 2022, although fans expected an update long before now. Analysts suggested the next move would be to release a series of iPads using the A16 chip, but if the plan was to include Apple Intelligence on the next releases, Apple might have waited until a more powerful, smaller chip was available. Adding Apple Intelligence to an iPad mini before this might have been possible, but prohibitively costly.

Either way, it’s nice to see advanced features coming to an entry-level device — especially one that’s only $349. This iPad might be small, but it packs quite a punch, and its functionality will only grow as Apple Intelligence rolls out."

Franziska Gabbert/dpa

Berlin (dpa) — iPhone owners are gradually noticing all sorts of things that the latest operating system update has brought to their phones.

As well as improvements to Apple’s AirPods Pro headphones, the latest software changes include the ability to adjust the width of the flashlight's light beam.

""What, why?,"" you might be asking. Well, Apple believes there are certain scenarios where you might not want a broad beam of light, but a slim one to pinpoint a certain spot.

Apple says the iPhone’s flashlight beam can now be configured by holding down the Dynamic Island area when the flashlight is activated.

An on-screen animation of the beam then allows you to focus the light into a narrow cone or spread it wider. As before, the brightness of the flashlight can be adjusted in four levels.

Meanwhile, For any iPhone owners with AirPods Pro, iOS 18 and the latest firmware (7A294) allows you to communicate with the voice assistant Siri using head gestures. For example, if a call comes in when you’re wearing the earbuds you can nod your head to take the call or shake it to reject it.

Apple says it has improved the audio quality of phone calls with AirPods Pro for the person you are talking to. And the audio latency is also said to have been reduced, something which is particularly important for gamers.

You can find out which AirPods firmware version you have by going into the iPhone's Bluetooth menu while the AirPods are connected and tapping on the earbuds’ ""i"" symbol."

After five joyous years as an Android user, curiosity got the best of me – I’ve been using an iPhone 15 for the last week or so to re-immerse myself in iOS and offer stronger contributions to our iPhone coverage.

Overall, I’ve been impressed by last year’s base-model iPhone. A lot has certainly changed since I parted with my iPhone 5S in 2019, and in the ten years between the launch of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 15, Apple has improved the iPhone in nearly every way, from the screen size (4 inches to 6.1 inches) to the battery life (a couple of hours to nearly all day) and connectivity (USB-C!).

Regrettably, there remains one thing that Apple did not improve in the decade of development between my previous and present iPhone, and it’s not been fixed with the new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus either.

In the world of Android, 120Hz is the new normal for flagship and high-end phone displays, while budget options are commonly equipped with 120Hz or 90Hz displays. These days, 60Hz displays are the preserve of tablets and the cheapest budget phones. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are, by modern standards, complete oddballs.

iPhone 13 Pro

The 60Hz debacle has been a focus of debate here at TechRadar for years now; ""Please, Apple – don't do this to the iPhone 15"" wrote Managing Editor for Mobile Computing Roland Moore-Colyer in the run-up to the phone's launch back in 2023, and Phones Editor Axel Metz found that 120Hz changed his entire outlook on iPhones when he switched to the iPhone 15 Pro.

Apple is more than capable of producing high refresh rate phone displays, as the ProMotion displays on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max demonstrate. In my experience, the smaller the screen, the more the benefit of a higher refresh rate is felt, as your eye has less space to work with to accommodate jagged motion.

To me, this is simply the most egregious example of Apple’s famously blunt product stratification strategy.

There is simply no user benefit to fitting iPhones with 60Hz displays, and the Samsung Galaxy S24 shows us that a company can deliver a flagship phone with a 120Hz display for $799, the same price as the iPhone 16. This partially counters arguments centered on component price or manufacturing costs.

So, why does Apple continue to sell iPhones with slow refresh rate panels? To me, this is simply the most egregious example of Apple’s famously blunt product stratification strategy, a considered choice to drive customers towards the more expensive iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.

It’s a shame, too – I’ve been otherwise impressed by the iPhone 15, and our iPhone 16 review found that Apple’s latest flagship brings the base model closer than ever to its Pro counterpart. Understandably, the standard and Pro iPhones need to be separated somehow, but here, Apple continues to enforce distance by limiting the low-end model rather than enhancing its premium offering.

This is a regrettably common Apple tactic. The exact same issue applies to the iPad Air and iPad Pro, and the cheapest MacBook Pro is still sold with a puny 8GB of RAM – decisions that drive people towards more expensive options.

I’m far from an Apple hater – I’m a longtime iPad user and converted from Windows to Mac last year – but this kind of behavior is my pick for Apple’s worst bad habit. Apple has made its name by thinking differently, but when it comes to refresh rates, I’m afraid everyone else is right.

A video is doing the rounds across social media, showing how, why and where Apple hides a dig at The Beatles in every computer made – yes, including yours. What... why? I hear you ask.

You may have heard about the decades-long legal battle between Apple and The Beatles. If not, in essence it was a typical trademark battle over the rights to the name 'Apple', which originally belonged to the holding company for The Beatles record label, Apple Corps (founded in 1968). In 1974 Apple Computers came along, using the same name (and eventually one of the best logos ever). Apple Corps didn't like that much and began a multi-stage legal battle that spanned between 1978 and 2007.

The cases were settled by Apple Computers agreeing to stay out of music and Apple Corps promising the same for computers. But Apple was not so quick to let go of the dispute, and hid a cheeky reference to the drama in Apple OS. Check out the Instagram video by Alex aka Pop Culture Brain below, which explains it all.

A post shared by Alex (@popculturebrain) A photo posted by on

The Beatle's lawsuit Easter egg comes in the form of a sound file installed on every Mac. While Apple had promised to stay out of music (way before iTunes came along, obviously), the company was creating sound files for its computers because, of course, computers need to play sound. In 1991, one beep-like sound was created and was going to be called 'chime', but Apple's legal team deemed the name too musical and canned it.

In retaliation (and frustration, I imagine), the lead engineer Jim Reekes reportedly joked about calling the sound 'Let it Beep' (get it?), but eventually settled on 'Sosumi' – so sue me, a veiled dig at the lawyers putting such a stranglehold on creativity. In 2020, the file was renamed in macOS' Big Sur update to 'Sonumi' (because it is 'new'). But the original name still lies in the system's sound library as 'sosumi.aiff'. Here it below, in both its iterations.

Apple has been involved in its fair share of court battles over trademark, so it's fair to say it's gone on to give as good as it got in those early days from The Beatles. Some were more understandable than others, though. We were somewhat bemused it went after a fruit company for daring to include a pear in its logo, for example, but we could see its point with this lookalike Apple logo.

Of course, the Beatles have one of the most well known logos ever – and that mark also has a very bizarre history attached. You can see some of the earliest Beatles logo sketches here."

MacOS Sequoia is shaping up to be one of the most significant updates to Apple’s desktop OS. It lets you control an iPhone from a Mac , drag windows to automatically snap into a side-by-side layout, and access a full-fledged password manager app. For most users, though, arguably macOS Sequoia’s headlining addition — Apple Intelligence — isn’t even live yet. However, over the last couple of weeks, I’ve had a chance to test it on the update’s beta release. How much are you missing out on?

Apple Intelligence brings a variety of long-overdue Generative AI features across macOS, similar to the ones found on Windows 11. A writing aid, for example, will allow you to instantly proofread your text or rewrite it from scratch in a more professional tone, a more capable Siri will understand when you speak in natural language instead of preset commands, an AI will summarize your emails on demand, and more.

However, as has been evident from the success of apps like ChatGPT, Generative AI capabilities can prove to be a hit or a miss, and more importantly, the models behind them can take a toll on a device’s performance. I tried Apple Intelligence on an M1 Mac Mini, the lowest hardware spec you need to run it, for a couple of weeks; Here’s what it’s like to use it and whether it will change how you use macOS.

Screenshots of the Apple Intelligence tools in macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta

How to use Apple Intelligence in macOS Sequoia

Since Apple Intelligence is in beta, though, it does come bearing a handful of asterisks.

At the time of writing, Apple Intelligence tools were available on the macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta, and out of the box, you may not notice their presence. For now, Apple has kept them an opt-in feature, meaning you must head into the settings and manually activate them. Even when you do that, your Mac won’t immediately become AI-smart.

Once you toggle on Apple Intelligence in its dedicated new Settings page clubbed alongside Siri, you will join a waitlist, and it could take hours or days for your turn to arrive. For me, it took a couple of reboots for my Mac to begin setting up the local AI models that power Apple’s new “personal intelligence system.”

Since Apple Intelligence is in beta, though, it does come bearing a handful of asterisks. For one, Apple explicitly warns the generative models’ outputs “may be inaccurate, unexpected, or offensive” and recommends verifying “important information for accuracy.”

Second, you won’t find the entire collection of AI-backed Mac features Apple demoed months back at its WWDC keynote. Notable absentees include Generative Playground, an app to generate AI images, and the ability to integrate Apple Intelligence with ChatGPT. That said, there’s still plenty to experience, and it offers a promising glimpse into how we all may operate a Mac in the future.

Screenshots of the Apple Intelligence tools in macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta

On Writing Tools

The centerpiece of the Apple Intelligence rollout, as is the case with most tech giant’s Generative AI abilities, is a series of writing tools. They live inside the right-click menu and are available when you select a piece of text on any app. This means they work across the system and are not limited to the apps that release updates to support Apple Intelligence.

Inside the “Writing Tools” dropdown, you’ll find a few options that should be familiar to those who have used Generative AI-powered services before. “Proofread” checks for any grammatical or consistency errors and rewrites the selected text with the changes, “Rewrite” attempts to redo the text in another direction, and there are even shortcuts to make it more professional, friendly, and concise.

These functions are fairly straightforward and pop out the results in a small floating window, so you don’t have to switch apps to access them. They work as intended, and more often than not, I’ve found them accurate and free of hallucinations. I also found the “Copy” button underneath them handy.

Screenshots of the Apple Intelligence tools in macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta

Some of these tools could use a Rewrite

However, there’s little room for customization. At times, Apple’s models aren’t aggressive enough, and the updated text resembles the original. Hitting the “Rewrite” button doesn’t much help either. In such cases, on other AI apps like ChatGPT, I could enter a prompt, and request the AI to zero in on the task.

Speaking of which, the lack of a prompt box isn’t ideal, as it would enable me to produce an outcome precisely to my needs. If I’m editing a marketing document, for example, I can simply ask ChatGPT to behave like a marketing exec, as opposed to a general-purpose writer. I’d also prefer it if Apple’s Writing Tools window showed me exactly what it has updated.

In addition, while having writing tools in a floating window is nice, I wish I could make them stick, especially when I need them frequently on programs like Pages. The “Show Writing Tools” option brings up the functions in a better-designed menu than a dropdown but it doesn’t affect its nature. The window and the text I produced go away as soon as I click anywhere else. Hopefully, Apple will make accessing Writing Tools possible through a keyboard shortcut or a permanent sidebar.

Screenshots of the Apple Intelligence tools in macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta

Summing up Writing Tools

I was more intrigued by Apple Intelligence’s ability to break down and summarize the text.

Instead of the rewriting abilities, I was more intrigued by Apple Intelligence’s ability to break down and summarize the text. Apart from prompting it to generate brief digests of a paragraph, for example, it can pick up and list down the key points and turn them into a list or a table. When I asked it to rewrite a laptop review’s conclusion into a tabular form, it created a column for a feature, and another for its verdict. “One of the most comfortable for typing,” for instance, was put in the “Keyboard” row.

While Writing Tools works on its own in a snap, I would expect it over time to be better integrated into at least Apple’s native apps. I could, of course, select an online article’s entire text, and go through a multi-step dropdown to summarize it, but it would simply make more sense to have a quick “Summarize” button on Safari, like you do on Microsoft Edge.

Some of that has already been put into action. On the Apple Mail app, there’s now a nifty “Summarize” button on top of each email that produces a mini synopsis of its content. Here too, though, there are signs of a half-baked beta. Like on AI email services such as Shortwave, there’s no redo button, and clicking the thumbs-down icon next to a summary simply lets you send your feedback to Apple, not regenerate it.

Screenshots of the Apple Intelligence tools in macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta

Siri is your more human-sounding and helpful macOS guide

On macOS Sequoia, Siri also knows a whole lot more about your Mac.

The other, major Apple Intelligence-powered addition you’ll come across on macOS Sequoia is the new Siri. Thanks to Generative AI, it is much less robotic now, and better at understanding the way humans typically talk, leading to fewer mistakes and quicker replies. I’m also a fan of the crisp new textbox design, which supports text input in addition to voice and hovers in the corner surrounded by a colorful gradient.

On macOS Sequoia, Siri also knows a whole lot more about your Mac. When I’m stuck figuring out how to perform a certain Mac function, I no longer have to head to Google; I can just double-press the command button and ask Siri. In subsequent updates, your Mac’s Siri will be more aware of your personal context and able to easily look up local files and data shared with you on compatible messaging apps.

A sprinkling of AI shows a path to the future

Apple has sprinkled AI in smaller quantities throughout the OS, and though it may not be groundbreaking, it will undoubtedly usher in more quality-of-life upgrades. The Email app, for example, will be smarter at pushing high-priority correspondence to the top, and the Photos app will let you find media by describing what’s in them. In the coming months, macOS will also gain a dedicated app to generate AI images and a Google Photos-like “Clean Up” tool to remove distracting objects in your photos.

More importantly, Apple will soon allow you to link the ChatGPT app with your Mac’s onboard AI functions. This will eliminate some of the concerns I have at the moment, like the lack of a prompt box, and enable Apple Intelligence to tap into the broader web’s knowledge. Its success, though, depends on what kind of guardrails Apple puts in place to prevent abuse and reinforce privacy. For now, as far as writing aids are concerned, you’re better off with third-party apps like Elephas and ChatGPT.

Screenshots of the Apple Intelligence tools in macOS Sequoia 15.1 public beta

Beta today, better tomorrow

Apple Intelligence won’t revolutionize how you operate your Mac yet, but I can see how it could refine your experience one update at a time. It’s similar to the advancements tech companies have made over the years with the help of much less glamorous machine learning technologies.

Searching your Mac, for example, will be a more convenient process if you could just ask Siri to look it up for you. Similarly, reading lengthy emails to understand whether they matter to you or belong in the bin will be a thing of the past, thanks to instant summaries. But in its current form, Apple Intelligence is truly what Apple calls it: a beta, not nearly the “personal intelligent system” the Cupertino company plans to offer."

Quick Summary

After some high-profile quality control issues, Apple is reportedly slowing down its product update strategy to move away from annual releases for non-iPhone devices.

This could start to come into force from next year.

For some years now Apple has been on a fairly predictable schedule: it releases new iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches in September, it updates its Macs in October or November and there are typically new iPads and other products in the spring. However, it is claimed the release cycle is putting too much pressure on the company's engineers, so Apple is reportedly going to update some of its hardware at a more leisurely pace.

The change won't affect the iPhone. Annual updates are a crucial part of Apple's calendar: for all kinds of reasons including marketing and revenues, so the annual iPhone event is here to stay. But, according to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, this year's Apple Watch launch was the shape of things to come.

What does a slower schedule mean for Apple devices?

This year's Apple Watch event updated the core Apple Watch – but it simply added a new colour for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and it didn't unveil the next generation of Apple Watch SE.

As Gurman explains, that kept the focus firmly on the core Apple Watch model; the other two models will get updated next year and then likely remain on a two-year schedule.

One of the reasons Apple is reportedly doing this is because of quality control. For example iPadOS 18 had to be pulled from the new iPad Pros because of serious software issues – it was only re-released for those devices last week – and the third beta of watchOS 11.1 had to be pulled too. Last month, there were software issues with HomePods.

The problem, it seems, is that Apple doesn't have different teams for different devices.

Gurman gives the example of Apple's audio engineers: they don't just work on AirPods, but also on the speakers for HomePods and Apple Watches, iMacs and MacBook Pros. Not only that, but those devices are using various operating systems.

The current Apple hardware range runs watchOS, iOS, iPadOS, macOS and tvOS, and there's apparently a homeOS coming too. That's an awful lot of bases to cover, and the recent software issues in particular suggest that Apple is trying to do too many things in too short a time period."

World Mental Health Day, which helps raise awareness of mental health issues worldwide, was first celebrated in 1992. It’s organized by the World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH). This year’s theme is “It is Time to Prioritize Mental Health in the Workplace.”

Apple

In recent years, Apple has added several mental-health-related tools to iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. For example, Apple’s State of Mind feature allows users to log their momentary emotions and daily moods. Research shows that reflecting on one’s mental status helps build emotional awareness and resilience. Additionally, the Apple Watch can track a user’s exposure to light, which studies have shown can reduce anxiety and stress and increase positive feelings.

Apple has also introduced a native Journal app on iPhone that lets users capture critical moments of their day. Journaling is another tool that has been shown to improve well-being. Finally, Apple’s Focus tool is available to help reduce distractions and allow users to disconnect while concentrating on one specific task, such as work, sleep, or exercise.

In addition to Apple’s native Mindfulness app, numerous third-party apps can integrate with the Apple Health app to track data. These apps can assist you in monitoring your meditation and mindfulness practices, setting goals, and gaining insights into your progress.

Some popular apps include meditation apps like Headspace and Calm, fitness apps like MyFitnessPal, and sleep-related apps like Sleep Cycle."

Apple’s iPad Mini 6 is at a quite low price right now. Being smaller it is oriented more on the consumption side than the creative side, though our iPad Mini 6 review states that you’ll likely use it for “reading, content consumption, and just a bit of content creation.” The review also mentions that it has loud speakers, which you might not expect for its fit-me-in-your-pocket body size.

How to Choose an Apple Deal on Prime Day

Apple’s current lineup of products is a bit more complex this year compared to a few years ago when your choices were pretty straightforward. For example, there is a new iPhone 16 out, but that lineup seems to be pretty thoroughly targeted to gaming and AI markets. If you don’t have an interest in either, then going for the previous iPhone 15 probably makes a lot more sense, especially if you look at our breakdown of the iPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus.

Luckily, things are a little bit clearer on the laptop side, especially as Apple makes some of the best laptops; if you want a general-use laptop, go for the MacBook Air, and if you want something for creative work, go for the MacBook Pro. Of course, you do then need to worry about the chip you get, but both the M2 and M3 are pretty solid. Also worth noting is that the RAM isn’t great on MacBooks in general, so you’ll have to pay a premium if you want more than 8GB.

When it comes to watches, there is the new Watch Series 10 that you could check out, but the Watch Series 9 is still pretty solid. If you want the best of the best, then the Watch Ultra 2 is the way to go, but that one is incredibly pricey, so you’ll definitely want to wait for a deal on it. On the other hand, if you want a cheaper watch, then the Watch Series SE is the better option, and there are two generations you can pick from, with the latest being the Watch Series SE 2.

How We Chose These Apple Prime Day Deals

Apple is probably the most well-known premium brand in electronics, so naturally, pretty much everything Apple sells is very expensive for the average person. As such, we have quite a bit of experience when it comes to finding and recommending Apple deals, especially given that everything from its laptops to its AirPods are high-end products. Even so, we do our best to find the most significant deals we can before putting them on this page so that we can make sure you get them at the cheapest price they are going for on the market.

Luckily, Prime Big Deal Days is one of the biggest tech sales events of the year, so Apple products tend to have their prices slashed quite significantly. Not only that, but there are a lot of great carrier deals that can bring prices down too, so we’re always on the hunt for finding you the cheapest way to buy Apple products."

According to Gurman, we’re likely to see a low- and high-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, both packing the M4 chips. There will also be a 16-inch high-end MacBook Pro. As for the Mac mini, Gurman previously reported that the upcoming M4 Mac mini may be tiny compared to its predecessors, with a build roughly the size of an Apple TV box. The size reduction may also mean it drops the USB-A ports . Following the fall releases, Gurman predicts Apple will have a bunch of other products ready for early 2025, including a 13-inch and 15-inch M4 MacBook Air, along with a refreshed iPhone SE and iPad Air in both sizes."

Apple announced that its suite of next-gen AI features would make their way to supported hardware in October. Today, Bloomberg reports that rollout of those AI features – clubbed under the Apple Intelligence banner – will begin on October 28.

The AI toolkit will arrive with the iOS 18.1 update for the iPhone 15 Pro pair, the entire iPhone 16 series, and iPads with M1 (or newer) silicon in the series. Unfortunately, this is not the full Apple Intelligence package that the company announced a while ago.

On the contrary, it’s just a phased rollout, which means we are only getting a few of those tricks. Among them are Writing Tools, a suite of AI-driven features that perform tasks like summarization, proofreading, and style adjustment, to name a few.

Nadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends

Writing tools will be available in a majority of Apple products, such as Notes, Mail, and Pages, followed by third-party apps. The Notes and Phone apps are also getting an automatic transcription and summarization convenience.

The update will also add a new Reduce Interruptions mode that intelligently silences the barrage of notifications and only allows the important alerts to pass through. On a similar note, we have notification summaries, which seem to be working just fine during the beta testing phase.

As far as the meatier feature updates, such as the ChatGPT integration, goes, they will only be here with the iOS 18.2 update at a later date. Moreover, Siri’s ability to cross-talk with external apps and access their data for more effective voice-based control will reportedly be ready with the iOS 18.4 build that arrives next year.

Nadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends

“I’m told that Apple is taking its time with the rollout to ensure that major bugs are eliminated and it can support all the new traffic on its AI cloud servers,” writes Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

It seems Apple Intelligence could still use a lot of work. The Writing Tools work, but only when dealing with English (US) language. A similar situation applies to audio note transcription and voicemails as well.

Support for more languages will only arrive “over the course of the next year,” says Apple. In hindsight, the staggered rollout also makes sense, as it gives Apple time to polish its AI products and avoid landing in embarrassing AI flub scenarios that have already hit Google and Microsoft in their race for AI dominance."

According to 9to5Mac, Apple is also planning to use the phone as a launching pad for its in-house 5G modems. The company purchased the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business for $1 billion back in 2019 after taking steps to be more self-reliant and aggressively recruiting staff to make that happen. But it has yet to release devices that use the modems designed by its internal team.

Apple and Qualcomm have somewhat of a complicated history. Qualcomm sued Apple in 2017, accusing it of violating its patents related to its phones' ability to quickly connect to the internet after they're switched on, as well as patents related to battery efficiency, graphics processing and apps' capability to download data faster. They eventually settled their patent dispute after Apple agreed to pay Qualcomm royalties and to enter a six-year licensing deal, as well as a multi-year wireless chipset supply deal.

At the moment, Apple still equips its devices with Qualcomm-made 5G modems. Qualcomm also announced last year that it will continue providing modems to Apple until 2026. It's possible that Apple wants to put its in-house modem to the test with just one iPhone first before it puts its technology in more devices.

The iPhone SE 4 will look similar to the iPhone 14 (pictured above), 9to5Mac says, and will be powered by an A18 chip with 8GB of RAM that will make it possible for it to have some Apple Intelligence features. It will reportedly feature Face ID and will no longer have a home button like previous iPhone SEs, and the device will apparently have the iPhone 15's 48MP wide camera and 12MP front cam. The iPhone SE 4 is expected to be unveiled next year, possibly sometime in the spring."

That’s it. That’s the tweet. OK, I’ll expand. That means you can now use the best device for watching free, over-the-air (OTA) broadcast channels on what we consider to be the best streaming hardware you can buy.

It’s been a long time coming. This fourth-gen Tablo has been available for about a year. And in that time, it’s worked great on the major platforms like Roku and Amazon Fire TV. You connect an antenna to the Tablo, fire up the app, and watch — and record — free broadcast channels on multiple devices. And you can do so on up to four devices at once, depending on whether you get the two- or four-channel Tablo. You’ll also get a number of free, ad-supported channels — because you can’t go anywhere in 2024 without running into a FAST channel.

Tablo has long been one of the two major options for watching OTA channels on multiple devices over your home network. It also was the easiest if you wanted to record anything on those channels. And the latest model released in fall 2023 improved on the experience in almost every way, as we explained in our full Tablo review. The hardware is better. The onscreen guide is about as good as any. And you can expand on the internal storage by plugging in an external hard drive. And most important — no additional subscriptions. It absolutely lapped the likes of HDHomeRun, both in terms of experience (HDHomeRun’s app remains awful) and support, which still exists, but it’s definitely dwindled over the years.

Buy at AmazonMissing, however, was support for Apple TV. That’s now changed. You’ll need a fourth-gen Tablo, of course, and also the App from the Apple TV App Store. (Be sure to get the dark-blue one, which works with this latest model.)

The only “major” feature missing here is support for ATSC 3.0, otherwise known (or not) as NextGen TV, which allows for, among other things, higher resolution and data to flow from your end of the equation back to the folks showing the shows and selling the ads. That’s very much been stuck in a chicken-and-egg situation, and Tablo hasn’t been in any hurry to wade into that mire. (There also have been patent issues that have kept many from adopting the ATSC 3.0 standard.)

In any event, this is a good thing for Apple TV owners who want a way to watch their local channels for free."

Apple debuted this model last year as its most budget-friendly Apple Pencil so far, and this sale makes the peripheral even more wallet-friendly. However, Apple's long had a problem with making it clear to consumers which version of the stylus is compatible with their iPad .

While you can attach it to the side of iPads with magnetic holders for safekeeping and convenience, there's no support for magnetic charging. Pressure sensitivity isn't available and you can't use Apple's nifty double-tap feature.

With the iOS 18.1 in public beta, giving anyone with a compatible phone the chance to test out the Apple Intelligence features that mark Apple's initial push into AI, the official release window is top of everyone's mind. Thanks to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, we've got a better idea of when highly anticipated features like Genmoji, Image Playground, and more will roll out.

You can expect the first sight of Apple Intelligence, other than for beta testers that is, to come with iOS 18.1's official launch sometime in mid-October.

""We should be looking for the software upgrade by the middle of October,"" Gurman said in his PowerOn newsletter.

Don't get too excited though, as several notable features won't arrive until iOS 18.2 or later, he added, echoing a previous report about the Apple Intelligence rollout timeline. iOS 18.2 should add ChatGPT integration and introduce Genmoji, which uses AI to generate emojis based on inputted text or based on someone from your Photos library, as well as Image Playground, Apple's answer to Google's Pixel Studio that lets you use AI to create images of yourself and others.

Apple is currently working on getting iOS 18.2 ""down to zero-bug status in early November,"" Gurman said. If history stands, that means a release window should be sometime in December. Another update could also come before the holidays with iOS 18.3, but it's expected to be a reality minor one, and it's unclear if any other Apple Intelligence features will be added with it, according to a recent MacRumors report.

As for Apple's planned overhaul to its Siri virtual assistant, which promises to give users better contextual and personalized responses, don't expect that to be available until March with iOS 18.4, he added.

Apple Intelligence features to expect with iOS 18.1

You can already test out Apple's new suite of AI features in the iOS 18.1 public beta, so we have an idea of what to expect when the full release comes. Easily the most noteworthy is Clean Up, an AI photo editing tool called Clean Up that's essentially Apple's version of Google's Magic Eraser. It easily lets you touch up your images, removing distracting objects or photo-bombers, with a couple of taps right there in the image gallery.

And while the promised overhauled Siri is still a ways off, Apple has upgraded its virtual assistant to improve its understanding of follow-up requests and when users trip over their tongues. Other new AI-powered features include notification summaries and suggested replies for Messages, Mail, and other apps; writing tools that can proofread drafts or rewrite them for specific audiences; article summaries when using Reader Mode in the Safari app; AI-generated phone call recordings and transcriptions; the option to type a description to create a Memories movie in the Photos app; and a new focus mode that automatically prioritizes only the most important or urgent notifications.

Of course, you'll need one of the best iPhones like the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any of the latest iPhone 16 series to enjoy Apple Intelligence once it does begin to rollout.

Apple Intelligence will usher in a lot of new features around images, whether it's generative image editing or creating a movie out of photos stored on your iPhone using just a text prompt. But the most useful change coming via Apple Intelligence may be one that helps you find the images you already have. And it's got implications that could extend beyond the devices capable of running Apple Intelligence.

I'm talking about natural language search, which is coming to the Photos app in the first round of Apple Intelligence feature updates arriving on the iPhone next month. According to Apple, you'll be able to find photos and videos just by describing what you're looking for — not keywords, but actual descriptive phrases like you're talking to another human.

Natural language search is part of the Apple Intelligence features included in the iOS 18.1 public beta, so anyone who's installed that update on a compatible iPhone can take the new feature out for a whirl. And that's exactly what I've been doing as I've used this new form of searching to plumb the depths of my image library. Here's what I've learned about the changes Apple's made to photo searching.

What's new with photo searches

searching for photos of my daughter drinking a milkshate in Photos on iOS 18.1

In olden times — well, iOS 17 — you'd search for images in the Photos app, one image at a time. If I wanted to find a particular photo of my daughter drinking a milkshake from a trip to Hollywood a few years back, I might start by searching for pictures of her with her name. Then, I could try entering terms like ""milkshake,"" or ""Hollywood"" or ""2022."" I might get lucky, and the photo I was searching for would appear; most of the time, it would not. (In the case of the milkshake photo, no dice — at least on an iPhone 15 still running iOS 17.)

But on an iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 18.1 all I have to do is start typing ""Prunella drinking a milkshake."" All the photos matching that description will appear, letting me choose precisely the one I want.

Using natural language search, it's a lot easier to find exactly the shot you're looking for. You might get more than one photo in your search results, but it's a lot more precise than what the old method of searching in Photos might yield.

search results appear as you type in iOS 18.1 Photos

I should also note that results start to appear as you type, so you may even find your photo before you finish entering in your natural language search. I wanted to track down a photo from a baseball game in Houston that I attended with a friend, so I decided to search for ""Jason in an Astros shirt."" All the photos from that game by the time I got to ""Jason in an astr,"" which is an incredible time saver.

Prior to natural language search, I probably wouldn't have even turned to the search feature in Photos to find that photo at all. Instead, I would have scrolled back through my photo library to the year I thought that game might have taken place. Since the human memory has a habit of forgetting precise dates — particularly when you're an Old like me — you can see the inherent flaw in that approach. In iOS 18, searching now involves a lot more hits than misses.

Some search hiccups

Search terms showing different results in iOS 18.1 photos search

As natural as it may be to search for photos using Apple Intelligence, not every phrase is going to work for you. I tried looking for all of the photos I had of my daughter at night — the search feature apparently has a problem telling night from day, as no results turned up. Other variations on the term — ""at sunset,"" ""after dark,"" ""in the evening"" also came up blank. (Though as I started typing ""eve,"" photos from various Christmas Eves did appear only to vanish when I added the ""ning."")

I wanted to find a video of a mariachi band that I captured at a Fourth of July parade from several years back, but ""mariachi band"" didn't turn up any results. A search for ""music at parade"" did, however, which runs counter to my experience that more specific search terms work better. In natural language searching, that appears not to be the case. (For what it's worth, ""mariachi band at parade"" did turn up results — some of which didn't actually feature a mariachi band. Your guess is as good as mine.)

You might have detected that the last search included a video, so yes, natural language search handles video as well as photos. In fact, Apple's preview page for Apple Intelligence says the AI feature ""can even find a particular moment in a video clip that fits your search description and take you right to it.""

I didn't have any luck with that specific use case in my testing, though I think that says more about the nature of videos I capture on my phone. Videos in my photo library tend to be short clips of people singing Happy Birthday at a get-together or my daughter doing a goofy dance to Alice Cooper music on the last day of school. I imagine the feature Apple describes works better on longer clips where something visually distinct happens later on in the video — a clown enters the scene or a dog leaps into view. Sadly, I don't own a dog, and I have no videos of clowns. That you know about, at any rate.

What about other iOS 18 phones?

Identical photos search results in iPhone 12 running iOS 18.1 and iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 12

If that's the kind of changes people with Apple Intelligence-ready iPhones can expect, what happens to search on iPhones that can run iOS 18, but lack the silicon and memory for Apple's new suite of AI tools? After all, since only the iPhone 15 Pro models and all of the new iPhone 16 handsets can run Apple Intelligence, there are a lot more iPhones out there that will be going without these features.

I tried to search for photos on an iPhone 12 that's running the iOS 18.1 beta (though, presumably, not benefitting from Apple Intelligence). And I'm pleased to report that the interface for searching for photos is the same as it was on the iPhone 15 Pro, as I had the ability to enter natural language search terms into a search field. Even better, a lot of the time, the results on my iPhone 12 matched those on my iPhone 15 Pro, even though the later supports Apple Intelligence and the other one does not.

""Waterfalls in Hawaii"" turned up the same video clips on both phones. When I searched for my daughter at the Eiffel Tower, more results actually turned up on the iPhone 12, and all of them were accurate.

different search results on an iPhone 12 and iPhone 15 Pro for Darth Vader photo

I'm not going to pretend all the searches worked the same on the iPhone 12 as they did on the iPhone 15. Searching for photos of me with Darth Vader produced two different shots where I'm standing in front of a Darth Vader statue at Lucasfilm's San Francisco headquarters. The iPhone 12 came up blank, so maybe you need Apple Intelligence to track down intellectual property.

I have mixed feelings about the fact that photo searches on older iPhones running iOS 18 feel more like the newer way of doing things even if the experience is a little more refined on Apple Intelligence phones. The old photo search method wasn't very useful, so it's nice that you don't need the latest Apple hardware to get a better experience. On the other hand, I'm not sure it's great for the platform that some phones running iOS 18 are getting the full search experience while others are getting that's close but slightly different.

It also takes away an argument for upgrading to a phone that can run Apple Intelligence. Maybe there are other features I can't run on that iPhone 12, but if I can enjoy better searches, perhaps that's enough to let me keep my current phone without upgrading. Then again, I suppose that's a Cupertino problem, not a Phil problem.

Photos search outlook

Like a lot of Apple Intelligence features, natural language search feels like a work in progress where a generally helpful features includes a few rough edges. Even with some search quirks, I think this is a much better approach to finding photos — and it seems to work on more iPhones than you might think.

In his latest report, Gurman says there are two versions in the works: a low-end display that will offer the basics, like FaceTime and smart home controls, and the high-end robotic variant that’ll cost upwards of $1,000.

We’ll reportedly see the cheaper version first — possibly next year — followed by the high-end display. Gurman previously said the robotic smart display could be released in 2026 at the earliest. You won’t have to wait for the premium model to get a taste of Apple’s vision for home AI, though. According to Gurman, Apple Intelligence will be a key part of the experience for both devices.

Apple has officially released the iPhone 16 and its variations, including the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Apple's It's Glowtime event revealed the upgrades to the phone, including better screen protection, camera features, and AI integration. Under the hood, the iPhone 16 Pro also boasts an even stronger CPU, with increased memory bandwidth and improved performance. If you've decided that the iPhone 16 Pro is your next buy, you should also get a case to keep it safe.

There are many kinds of cases out there to suit every style or preference. Here are some of our favorites.

The best budget iPhone 16 case

Pros

Good quality for the price

Comes in multiple colors

Includes screen protector

Cons

No camera protector

The best thing about the Spidercase iPhone 16 Pro Case isn't just its quality — it's the price you pay for that level of quality. It regularly costs under $20 for this translucent matte model, even at full price.

The Spidercase iPhone 16 Pro case excels in its simplicity. While it might not be the flashiest case, it covers all the basics and has some colorful options to boot. Its raised edges protect the delicate parts of the phone and reinforced corners absorb the shock from odd-angled drops up to 12 feet. The two glass screen protectors included with the case also save you the trouble of buying them separately.

Pros

Four-layer protection

Additional accessories

Includes belt clip

Cons

Bulky

The Pelican Voyager iPhone 16 Pro Case might just be the thickest on this list. It features four protective layers made of hard polycarbonate and soft elastomer, similar to the Otterbox Defender, but without the brand name. The anti-scratch coating and raised edges also protect your screen and camera. It has double the layers of many competitors and exceeds military grade drop protection standards.

As a bonus, the Pelican Voyager iPhone 16 Pro Case also comes with a belt clip so you can keep it at your side.

Want to take a dip? The Temdan iPhone 16 Pro Waterproof Case lets you take your phone anywhere, even underwater.

That way, you can use it during outdoor activities like swimming, snorkeling, and surfing. Its tempered glass screen protector also maintains the response sensitivity of the bare screen. Just be sure to close any holes with the silicone plugs before you go under. Temdan recommends testing the case underwater before putting your phone inside, just to make sure you know how it works before risking your device.

Pros

Rugged, military-grade protection

20-foot drop protection

Built-in screen protector and kickstand

Cons

No water resistance

Military-grade drop-tested cases that can protect your expensive new iPhone 16 Pro are not easy to come by. i-Blason’s MagSafe-compatible Armorbox has you covered.

Speck Candyshell Grip iPhone 16 Pro Case

The best grip-friendly iPhone 16 Pro case

Pros

Simple, but good at its job

Cushioned double layer

MagSafe compatibility

Cons

Expensive

Speck has been in the consumer tech accessory market since 2001, so of course, it's be ready for the launch of the iPhone 16 Pro with this specially fitted case.

This case features the company's signature CandyShell Grip coating, a slim layer made of silicone-like material with textured lines to help it grip to your pocket and palms. The case also keeps your phone relatively well-protected thanks to its double-layer construction and raised bezel to protect the screen and camera. All the basics are there, including MagSafe-compatible charging and an accessible design that easily responds to button presses.

Apple Silicone Case with MagSafe and Camera Control

Best official case for iPhone 16 Pro

Pros

Variety of colors

Soft touch material

Protection from everyday wear and tear

Seamless Camera Control cover

MagSafe compatible

Cons

Pricey

Can get lint and debris stuck easily

The Apple Silicone Case is a good option if you prefer official cases from Apple. The soft touch silicone material feels excellent and should add some grip to the device. It provides durable protection from everyday wear and tear, and the microfiber lining keeps it safe from scratches. It also has a relatively slim profile, making it a good choice if you don't like bulky cases.

Apple also made this case MagSafe compatible, and there is a seamless cover for the Camera Control that is made with sapphire crystal and has a conductive layer for flawless touch control.

The only thing to keep in mind is that the silicone can easily attract lint and debris, and it's also a bit pricey since it's an official Apple case.

Best subtle color case for iPhone 16 Pro

Pros

Jelly colors add a subtle tint to your iPhone

10-foot protection

MagSafe compatible

Plenty of colors

Cutout for Camera Control access

Cons

More on the feminine side

Sonix is a good brand if you want cases that are cute and stylish. The Jelly colors make for a translucent semi-transparent case that, when combined with your iPhone color, give a unique tint to the device. So if you have a darker color device, it will look darker, while lighter colors will make the selected color lighter. This is also a good option if you wanted a pink iPhone 16 Pro, but are disappointed that Apple could not deliver that yet again.

The Sonix cases have also been tested for up to 10-feet of drop protection and are compatible with MagSafe. The case also features tactile button covers, and there is a cutout for easy access to the Camera Control button. And if the jelly colors aren't your thing, there are other patterns and designs to choose from too.

The smart ring category is hot right now, but is Apple set to leap into the fray with its own effort?

In recent months we've seen the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Ring and the RingConn Smart Ring, while the long-term leader of the best smart rings race is the Oura Ring (now up to its third generation). Rumors that Apple might be tempted to join the party have been swirling for several years now, and it seems that there's at least something on the drawing board at Apple around this form factor.

Here, we've pulled together everything we know and think we know about the so-called Apple Ring: the leaks and rumors that have emerged, the predicted price, the possible release date and more. We've also added some of the features and specs we want to see from the Apple Ring.

Apple Ring: cut to the chase

What is it? A rumored smart ring, made by Apple

When could it release? TBC, but not before 2025

How much could it cost? Expect $399 / £399 / AU$750 or above

Apple Ring: price and release date predictions

Oura Ring 3 on a finger

We don't have too many clues about how much the Apple Ring could cost, but we can look at some of the other options on the market. The Samsung Galaxy Ring can be yours for $399 / £399 and up (with Australia prices to be confirmed), while the Oura Ring 3 is available for $299 / £299 and up (and isn't currently available in Australia).

That gives you some idea of the price points we're talking about. Apple will want to stay competitive, but (as the best iPhones show) isn't afraid to whack a price premium on its products. If we had to make a guess, we'd say the Apple Ring will be a little more expensive than its Samsung and Oura rivals.

It's also worth bearing in mind that the best Oura Ring features need a monthly subscription ($5.99 / £5.99 per month). Apple already has its Fitness Plus program you can sign up to if you have an Apple Watch ($9.99 / £9.99 / AU$14.99 per month), so it's entirely possible that this would also be an optional extra for its smart ring.

When it comes to a release date, 2024 and even 2025 seem unlikely, given the cadence of the leaks and rumors we've seen so far; it doesn't appear that a launch is imminent. We didn't see an Apple Ring alongside the Apple Watch 10 at the September 2024 It's Glowtime event, but there's an outside chance it might accompany the Apple Watch 11 in September 2025, assuming that device turns up as expected.

Apple Ring: leaks and rumors

Someone holding the Ringconn smart ring against a concrete background.

The Apple Ring rumors stretch back a long way, to at least 2020. A patent Apple filed that year showed a smart ring being used to control other devices – with the idea being that you could maybe change channels on your Apple TV with a tap on your ring. Of course, patents aren't always guarantees of future products, but they show what companies are thinking about and exploring.

Fast forward to 2023, and Apple was once again filing smart ring patents that positioned its possible device as some kind of controller for other gadgets. It seems that any Apple Ring that shows up won't just be focused on health and fitness – it will also give you new ways to control functions on your other Apple devices.

It would seem Apple isn't limiting itself to wearables around your fingers, either. Yet another 2023 patent revealed plans for some kind of Apple Anklet you could wear around your ankle or around your neck. The success of the Apple Watch clearly has Apple thinking about how to get you tracking more fitness metrics.

Meanwhile, an industry report out of South Korea early in 2024 suggested an Apple smart ring was on the way, to take on Samsung and Oura. However, as nothing has emerged in the months since, either the sources of the report got it wrong or Apple changed its mind about its future product launch schedule.

We've seen one further sign that an Apple Ring might be on the way: an Apple survey sent to Apple Watch owners, asking how many of them currently wear a smart ring alongside their smartwatch. It might be a bit of a stretch to use this as evidence of an Apple Ring, but it's not nothing.

And that's it for Apple Ring rumors – no hint of prices, specs, design, or anything specific like that. The lack of particulars in the rumors imply a launch might still be some way off in the future, though there's been enough noise at this point to suggest it's at least being considered.

Apple Ring: what we want to see

Apple Watch Series 10

In the event that an Apple Ring is indeed on the way, what will it be like – and how could it beat existing models? If any Apple engineers are reading this, here's what we want to see from an Apple smart ring.

1. Stellar battery life

This shows up in every wishlist for every device, of course, but decent battery life is a must – especially as the standard Apple Watch can't go more than a day or two without a recharge. In fact, that could be a key selling point for the Apple Ring: keep tracking your steps and other activities while your Apple Watch is on charge.

2. Top-tier sleep tracking

Speaking of Apple Watch recharging, many users charge theirs overnight. This means the smartwatch often can't be used for sleep tracking, and we're hoping this means the Apple Ring will be very good at it. Besides, the smaller size and lighter weight of a smart ring makes it more suitable for tracking the tosses and turns of your sleep anyway.

3. Lots of software features without subscription

We've already mentioned Apple Fitness Plus, but we'd hope many of the features of an Apple Ring would be available without a subscription – as they are with Apple Watch. And for those who wanted extra functionality such as fitness videos, customizations around workout plans, in-session metrics and more, there could be an extra subscription option.

4. A superior design

There really are only so many ways you can design a smart ring, but we're hoping Apple brings the same aesthetic tastefulness to the Apple Ring as it's shown with the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. We're thinking a super-slim and super-light form factor, a choice of different colors, and a smart ring that's one of the most comfortable on the market.

5. Seamless Apple ecosystem integration

Apple usually manages this perfectly, with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches getting new integrations and connections all the time – so we hope that extends to the Apple Ring. It's unlikely that Apple will want the smart ring to replace the Apple Watch, and in fact it could be a useful screen for it (bear in mind Oura has an Apple Watch app, too).

Quick Summary

Apple Intelligence will require 4GB of storage space on your iPhone when it launches from next month.

That is something to consider when you purchase your iPhone 16, especially if you're looking at the 128GB model.

We can't wait for Apple Intelligence to finally arrive and try out the new features we've learned about over the last few months. However, we've also recently learned that it'll come with a fairly hefty caveat.

Apple has confirmed that Apple Intelligence and its suite of tools will take up a large chunk of iPhone storage space – around 4GB, in fact. And that's on top of the not inconsiderable amount already used by iOS and system data.

That's largely fine for owners of 256GB handsets and above, but if you've recently bought a 128GB iPhone 16, you might want to consider keeping other apps and services to a minimum.

""Apple Intelligence is available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, all iPhone 16 models, and iPad and Mac models with M1 and later. iPhone devices need 4GB of storage,"" said Apple in a document published as part of the iOS 18.1 beta (via 9to5Mac).

Interestingly, the document doesn't go into details about storage requirements on other devices, such as the compatible iPads and Macs.

Apple is planning a staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, with some features potentially not hitting different regions until spring 2025.

It will start in the US next month (October) with the public release of iOS 18.1. The UK and some other English-speaking countries will get it ""by December"" as part of the following iPhone update – iOS 18.2.

That includes Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggests that some of the most eagerly-anticipated features won't arrive until next March, though. He claims that the new Siri, for example, might not be available until the iOS 18.4 update is available.

Non-English speaking variants of Apple Intelligence may take even longer still, with Apple so far just saying that Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish versions are ""coming next year"".

We'll report if we hear anything further on the rollout."

The tech giant added three Mac models to its ""vintage"" list and shifted nine others to the ""obsolete"" category.

This change in status means that the affected Mac models will see a significant change in their available support and repair services. Apple's product lifecycle defines vintage products as those the company stopped selling over five (but less than seven) years ago. While vintage products can still receive repairs from Apple Stores and authorized service providers, this depends on the availability of necessary parts.

On the other hand, any products marked as ""obsolete"" are those that Apple stopped selling over seven years ago. These products generally do not qualify for hardware service, and repair parts are not ordered for them. The major exception is for Mac laptop batteries, which might be eligible for replacement up to ten years after they stop being sold, though this exception is also contingent on the availability of parts.

The Mac models reclassified as vintage are:

MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)

MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, 2 Thunderbolt 3 Ports)

MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, 4 Thunderbolt 3 Ports)

Note that these obsolete Macs are stuck with macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 12 Catalina. They no longer receive software support from Apple, though the vintage Macs still fall under Apple's support windowâApple currently provides support for macOS 13 Venturas and later.

Owners of now-vintage Macs may still receive repairs from authorized service centers. Those with obsolete Macs will need to rely on third-party repair services or consider replacing their laptops and devices if they have any hardware issues, though battery replacements may still be offered, depending on parts availability.

The 14 percent discount is available on models with a Rugged Titanium Case for small to large wrists. This includes watches fitted with the Blue Alpine Loop, Indigo Alpine Loop, Orange Ocean Band and more.

Apple released the Ultra 2 in 2022 and, despite rumors, has yet to announce a successor. Our review gave the Ultra 2 an 85 thanks to features like its long battery life. It lasts for about 36 hours, letting us easily use it for three days without a recharge. Apple also claims it can get to about 60 hours with Lower Power Mode enabled, a setting that turns off the Always On Display and features like cellular connections and heart rate notifications.

We named the Ultra 2 the best Apple Watch for adventurer due to its sizable battery life, compass app, water temperature gauge and loud onboard siren in case you get in trouble. Plus, it can set waypoints and offers the Wayfinder watch face in Night mode. One of our quips about the watch, though, was that it was too easy to accidentally press the action button instead of the crown.

Apple's latest iteration of tvOS isn't anything to write home about if I'm being totally honest. There's more here than tvOS 17, which seemed to be focused more on using your Apple TV 4K for FaceTime calls rather than watching movies, but it's still fairly slim pickings for those who crave substantial new picture and sound features.

The main new features of note are a dialogue-enhancing sound mode, a system that shows you information on actors and music when you pause an Apple Original show, and new screensaver customisation. So, not any Earth-shattering AV upgrades to be seen then. That might not be the end of the world though, as the Apple TV 4K is still the best media streamer on the market, so I wasn't expecting any sort of revolutionary performance upgrade in the latest OS update.

However, while I was trawling through the settings of my streamer to identify any new features that took my fancy, I stumbled across a setting I wish I had known about sooner. Remapping the TV button to bring up the home screen instead of the Apple TV app is something I've wanted for quite some time – in fact I'm confused why it's not the default setting – but it turns out I've just not been looking hard enough.

I don't want to question the quality or functionality of the Apple TV app, as it's a useful tool that collates my content and houses an underrated collection of Apple Original content that supports Dolby Vision and Atmos. However, the fact it didn't have a dedicated button to reach the home menu on the Apple TV remote was always a peculiar choice in my mind; thankfully that's been rectified now. Before this, you'd need to either double-click the TV button and scroll back to the home screen via the app switcher, or press and hold the button to reach the home menu.

Will this change your life? Probably not. But it will save you a few precious seconds when swapping between streaming services, and in my experience, the press-and-hold gesture was somewhat temperamental. It's made navigating my Apple TV 4K easier, and the frequency with which I accidentally open the Apple TV app is already greatly reduced.

If you want to remap your TV button, simply navigate to the settings app, scroll down to ""Remotes and Devices"" and then select ""TV Button"" to toggle between opening the Apple TV app and opening the home menu.

Over the weekend I've been getting the hang of my new iPhone 16 Pro Max and it's exciting new camera button, but there's been something BUGGING me. Or at least I hope it's a bug. Sometimes, when I take a pic and go to look at it, I'm presented with a tiny thumbnail rather than a glorious screen-filling image.

The camera – too – seems to have been pretty poor at deciding which way up I was holding the phone!

It is clear, however, from other sources, that some aren't happy. British tabloids like the Daily Mail have piled in, too, but with a characteristic failure to understand the details, getting around the issue by reporting of more aggressive remarks. Or sharing tweets like this:

I going to take a slightly more rational approach (from now). The problem I've been experiencing, so far, isn't information overload. It's much more specific, but it's taken me time to pin it down, even though it's happened to me more than once and I've ended up having to quit the Camera or Photos app.

It doesn't help, of course, that the Camera and Photo apps are more or less interchangeable in my mind because I want to go straight into editing images. Apple has made the new iPhone 16 photography process all about the HEIF image file, recording enough data that – assuming you're in the Apple app – you can do more with (like a kind of camera-phone RAW file).

Eventually, on grabbing this rather unflattering image, I had the presence of mind to take a screen-capture of the phenomenon that was irking me.

iPhone 16 Pro Max

I've taken a photo – in this case a portrait – tapped straight to Photos to edit it once the thumbnail was visible, then clicked back and weirdly I'm presented with the image in a thumbnail AS IF viewed in a bigger grid, even though it is alone and tiny.

This is reminiscent of a bug discussed in the Apple forums after the iOS 17 update about missing thumbnails, except I'm not expecting to see thumbnails – I'm expecting to see the image I took filling the screen.

Well, OK, not filling the screen – because I expect the orientation to be corrected too. And it wasn't. Suggesting a lot of things about the image pipeline weren't happing as quickly as they should have been.

Now yesterday when I took this shot I'd also taken a few video clips and been playing with the EV compensation, but I'd still expect the basics to keep up, especially given how fast the A18 Pro seems to be in general.

If this is a bug more people are experiencing, then Apple are going to struggle to be considered the best camera phone, even with the massive usability boost the Camera Control button undoubtedly brings.

A potential explanation is that Apple has implemented some kind of aggressive memory control on the Photos app – and this hypothesis is backed up by Callum Jones of Unlaid.

I'd love to hear if this has affected anyone else?"

A lot of decisions go into making any smartphone. But if you want to pin down the most important choice Apple made when assembling its iPhone 16 lineup, look no further than the benchmarks for Apple's latest handsets — particularly the entry-level iPhone 16.

A quick glance at the performance section of our iPhone 16 review, shows Apple's phone racing far ahead of the competition in the Geekbench general performance benchmark. That's a reflection of the new A18 silicon Apple is using to power the standard iPhone 16, as all of the company's new phones feature some form of the A18. (The Pro models feature an A18 Pro chipset that has an extra core in its GPU.)

The iPhone 16 doesn't top Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered Android devices in every test. Phones powered by Qualcomm's top-of-the-line chipset still enjoy a lead in graphics benchmarks, though the A18 closes that gap considerably.

The larger point here is that the least expensive flagship phone Apple makes has turned out to be a formidable competitor on the performance front — and that's an argument that was a lot harder to make when Apple was using year-old silicon to power its entry-level phones. And that's why among the many decisions Apple made about which features to include in the iPhone 16, using an A18 system-on-chip has turned out to be the most important one, making the latest Apple handsets some of the best phones you can buy.

Apple's switch to different chips

iPhone 14

Prior to 2022, you didn't have to think about which chipset came with which iPhone. When Apple released new phones, it generally used the same silicon, even if its higher-end models might have come with a little extra horsepower.

That changed with the iPhone 14. While the Pro models that year benefitted from a new chipset, the standard iPhone 14 featured the same A15 Bionic Apple had used in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro models. It wasn't exactly the same chipset found in the iPhone 13 — the iPhone 14's A15 had an extra core in its GPU — but it wasn't a new model either. The iPhone 15 followed the same pattern, re-using the A16 Bionic that came with the iPhone 14 Pro.

You could argue that the move didn't exactly hurt Apple, as it likely pushed more people to buy the more expensive Pro phones. But I don't think it's a coincidence that iPhone revenue dropped in the company's 2023 fiscal year, which would have covered just about a full year of iPhone 14 sales.

Using older chips also created a perception that Apple's entry-level phones were afterthoughts — which was grossly unfair to a device like the iPhone 15. That handset saw a big camera improvement, a brighter display and a longer-lasting battery. But I think some people had a hard time looking past the fact that a phone released in the fall of 2023 was running on silicon first unveiled in 2022.

The standard iPhone makes a comeback

Apple iPhone 16 held in the hand.

The iPhone 16 shakes off that also-ran perception, with a lot of the credit going to the improvements Apple made to its new entry-level model. The Camera Control button isn't just an iPhone 16 Pro addition — Apple added to all models while bringing the Action button introduced a year ago to the rest of the iPhone lineup. That means the basic experience of using your iPhone is the same, whether you buy the $799 model or pay up for the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

But I keep coming back to the A18 chipset as the great equalizer for the iPhone 16. As you can see in the table comparing benchmark results, the iPhone 16 outpaces phones like the Galaxy S24 and OnePlus 12, both of which run on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. So does the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the iPhone 16 smokes that foldable on Geekbench, too. It's worth noting that for the $1,899 that the Fold costs, you could buy two iPhone 16s and still have $300 left over.

The most telling number, though, comes from our Adobe Premiere Rush test. We have each phone transcode a video clip in that app, timing the results. The iPhone 16 finishes the job in 22.5 seconds, nearly 17 seconds faster than the Galaxy S24 and also an improvement on the iPhone 15's time. That's a real-world performance number that shows you'll be able to do things faster on Apple's latest phones.

Apple managed to elevate the iPhone 16 while still establishing the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max as its premium devices. It's just that the balance in features is handled better with this iteration of the iPhone lineup. The Pro phones have the superior cameras, thanks to some clever hardware upgrades, and if you capture video, you'll prefer the superior shooting specs of Apple's more expensive models.

But going back to the experience of using an iPhone 16, it's essentially the same no matter which phone you end up buying. That's particularly true of the Apple Intelligence features that are coming to the phones in a software update next month (and already available as part of the iOS 18.1 public beta).

In other words, when you buy a new iPhone this year, you can expect a certain level of performance, regardless of which model is in your hand. That hasn't necessarily been the case in the past, but it's certainly true this year. And a lot of the credit goes to the A18 chipset.

iOS 18 arrived earlier this week, and with it came a whole bunch of impressive new features. Of those it’s clear that Apple Intelligence has been given the most attention. AI is a hot topic and this is Apple’s chance to show exactly what it’s capable of doing in the face of widespread competition. But that’s not my personal favorite iOS 18 feature.

No, my favorite feature is something that I’ve been clamoring Apple to offer for years now. Ever since I got my first taste of the Android operating system 13 years ago, in fact. Imperfect as the implementation might be, I am loving that Apple is giving users the opportunity to take full control over the look of the home screen — and where the app icons are all placed.

Home Screen in iOS 18 — Gaps are Good

iOS 18 home screen customization features

Back in 2011, when I first used an Android phone, there were a number of personalization features that made Apple’s home screen look childish in comparison. Not only did the app drawer mean apps didn’t need to live on the home screen, and be organized in some shape or form, there were a bunch more options.

There are a bunch of reasons why I’ve always sworn off iPhones. But the freedom to make my home screen look bizarre and disorganized to the casual observer — while making perfect sense to me — is one of them.

Those Android app icons could go just about anywhere you like, without snapping into an orderly list the way iOS did right up until this year. If you wanted to leave a gap on your home screen, that was absolutely something you could do. Some launchers even let you leave whole home screen pages blank, giving you a place to admire your wallpaper without any foreground interruptions. Plus, Android had widgets, which let you see and do certain things without ever having to open the app.

Over the years Apple has slowly added these features to iOS, though it’s taken a very long time to get there. Widgets arrived in a fashion with iOS 10, though they wouldn’t come to the home screen until 4 years later with iOS 14. iOS 14 also saw Apple launch the App Library, finally giving your stray apps somewhere to live that wasn’t the home screen. The following year iPadOS 15 gave tablet users the ability to place widgets wherever they liked.

It wasn’t until this year that this last freedom expanded to iPhones, and let you customize where your apps live on the lockscreen. And it’s about darn time too.

There are a bunch of reasons why I’ve always sworn off iPhones, compared to Android. Some of those things, like the consistent back button navigation, still haven’t happened yet. But the freedom to make my home screen look bizarre and disorganized to the casual observer (while making perfect sense to me) is one of them.

That said, as positive a step this is, Apple needs to do some tweaking on the implementation.

Some work is needed

iOS 18 home screen customization features changing icons color

The main problem with the new home-screen customization is that the old system is still clearly there. While it is possible to move icons around and place them wherever you like, the old-school grid format still comes into play sometimes. So when you move one icon, all the rest snap along to fill in the gap.

From the looks of things it all seems to be related to the very first square on the screen — situated in the top left under the time. If an app icon or widget is there, then everything you add next to it automatically snaps into the auto-correcting grid format.

Which is… weird. I understand that a lot of people might prefer the grid system, but the freedom to place icons wherever you like means you can always stick with the giant screen of app icons. It’s completely your choice. Trying to have both icon placement systems working in tandem just doesn’t work properly, and means someone could easily make a mistake and have to rearrange their whole home screen again.

This little quirk reminded me that iOS 18 lets you change the color of your home screen to a different tone, but forces you to have the same color across every app and icon. It makes me wonder whether Apple just hasn’t really got the idea of “personalization” considering it spent so many years restricting just how much was actually offered.

But hey, it’s certainly a step forward, even if it means Apple should continue tweaking the implementation of this feature.

iOS 18: My bottom Line

iOS 18 review

Apple Intelligence may be the part of iOS 18 that makes all the headlines, but there’s still a lot of extra stuff in the update that is worth checking out. Improved personalization is one of those things, and it’s the kind of feature that Apple should have delivered several years ago. Because what good is a phone if you can’t make it truly your own?

Home screen personalization is imperfect, with Apple clinging onto the old auto-organizing grid system. Whether that’s deliberate or accidental, I’m not sure, but it’s the kind of thing that definitely needs fixing in a future iOS update. But for now I’m just glad that it’s actually happened, even if it took 17 years. Now if Apple can just figure out a way to offer a consistent back button…

Why we like it

Read Mashable's full review of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Air.

Apple's latest MacBook Air takes the excellent design of its predecessor and upgrades it with a faster processor, support for WiFi 6E, and the ability to drive two external displays with its lid closed. It's our current favorite MacBook for most people and another Mashable Choice Award winner.

The base configuration of the 15-inch model (which has two more speakers than the 13-inch version) normally retails for $1,299, but you can order it from Amazon for $1,099. That's 15% off, and $50 away from its all-time low price from Amazon Prime Day 2024.

https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-just-launched-ios-18-175135694.html,www.yahoo.com,Apple just launched the iOS 18.1 public beta. Here’s how it’ll change your iPhone,,2024-09-19T17:51:35.000Z,en,neutral,0.9999908208847046,"['https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif', 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png', 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png']","This week is quickly shaping up to be a huge one for Apple fans. On Monday, Apple officially released iOS 18, watchOS 11, and macOS 15 to the general public. Tomorrow, regular sales begin for the new iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and Apple Watch Series 10. As if that weren’t enough, Apple is now rolling out its first public betas with Apple Intelligence features.

Starting today, September 19, the public betas for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1 are available for anyone to download. The main draw to these public betas is that they all include Apple Intelligence features, which were previously locked to the developer betas for these software versions.

iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1 won’t officially roll out until October. Still, if you’ve been eager to try Apple Intelligence but have been weary of putting a buggy developer beta on your device, this is the moment you’ve been waiting for.

Once you download these newest public betas, what Apple Intelligence features will you be able to use? All of the following are included in this first public beta:

Writing Tools

Improved Siri

Natural language search, Clean Up tool, and Create Memory Movies in the Photos app

Priority messages, email summaries, and Smart Reply in the Mail app

Message summaries and Smart Reply in the Messages app

Transcription summaries in the Phone and Notes apps

We tried Apple’s Writing Tools earlier this year and had mixed impressions of it. There are tools to proofread your writing and rewrite it in different tones — such as making you sound more friendly, professional, or concise. You can access Writing Tools in any app that uses a text field. On the iPhone, simply select your text to bring up the usual copy/cut/paste menu, and you’ll find a new Writing Tools button.

Nadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends

As for the improved Siri, these public betas include the new Siri design, the ability to type to Siri, and product knowledge of Apple gadgets. For example, if you ask Siri, “How do I take a screen recording?” you’ll get step-by-step instructions that will tell you what to do. Siri can also now understand you when you stumble over your words. For example, if you say, “Siri, set an alarm for 5:30 … no, actually set an alarm for 6:30,” the assistant should do a much better job of fulfilling those commands.

What’s not included in today’s public betas is ChatGPT integration with Siri. You also won’t find Siri’s personal context features, which allow the assistant to look through your messages, calendar, etc., and answer questions/commands around them.

Apple

Apple’s image creation tools, including Image Playground and Genmoji, are also missing. Similarly, Priority Notifications aren’t yet available. All of these things will be available later this year or sometime next year, with no precise ETA beyond that.

Apple Intelligence features are available for all iPhone 16 models, the iPhone 15 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max. iPads with an M1 chip or newer can use Apple Intelligence, while Macs with an M1 chip or later can also access Apple Intelligence.

To download the public betas for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or macOS 15.1, visit the Apple Beta Software Program website, sign in to your Apple account, and follow the instructions. Once you’ve downloaded and installed the public beta, open your Settings app, tap on Apple Intelligence & Siri, and tap the Join the Apple Intelligence Waitlist button. You should get access to Apple Intelligence features within a few hours and receive a notification once that happens.

Many of us at Digital Trends (myself included) are downloading these public betas ASAP and will have much more to say about them soon. Stay tuned."

The Watch GT 5 consists of three individual versions, a 41mm Watch GT 5, a 46mm Watch GT 5, and the Watch GT 5 Pro, plus there’s a new Huawei Watch Ultimate edition called the Fairway Green. Finally, it has also announced the Watch D2, which incorporates an all-in-one blood pressure management system. It’s hard to argue with the variety here, so lets dig into what makes each one special.

Huawei Watch GT 5

The three different Watch GT 5 models all use an octagonal bezel, but emphasize it in different ways. The 41mm takes on a more elegant look and has a rounder shape in general, while the Watch GT 5 Pro really shows off the angles and sharpness of the bezel’s shape for a more defined look. The 46mm Watch GT 5 sits somewhere in between the two distinct styles.

Choose the 41mm Watch GT 5 and you look at a 1.32-inch AMOLED screen with a 466 x 466 pixel resolution, while the 46mm and Watch GT 5 Pro have larger 1.43-inch screens. Each comes in different finishes and colors, with Huawei offering a full ceramic case option for the 41mm model, complete with a titanium bezel and sapphire crystal over the screen. The Pro and 46mm models come in titanium with a ceramic case back, and a choice of several bands in leather, rubber, metal, and even ceramic.

On the back of the watch is a new TruSense heart rate monitor that Huawei says provides more accurate results than before, plus it supports its Women’s Health 4.0 monitoring complete with skin temperature and trends data. The Pro model gets an electrocardiogram (ECG) feature, plus a new golf course mode with access to 15,000 different courses complete with real-time monitoring, hole previews, wind speeds and direction, and distance to each hole. Interestingly, the Watch GT 5 series has an IP69K water and dust resistance rating, ensuring it’ll withstand condensation and steam too.

Huawei Watch Ultimate Fairway Edition

The Huawei Watch Ultimate was originally released in mid-2023, and this is a special edition of that watch. As the name suggests, it’s targeted at golfers, putting it up against Garmin’s Approach or Marq Golfer smartwatches and the Tag Heuer Connected Caliber E4 X Malbon Golf Edition. It’s made from zirconium liquid metal, which Huawei says is even more durable than titanium, and the material has not been used on any other smartwatch. The dual-color bezel is made from ceramic.

A 1.5-inch AMOLED screen sits under a sapphire crystal and displays a selection of golf-specific watch faces. The case is attached to a new green woven strap, plus there’s a simple rubber strap included in the box. The golf watch face has 18 marks around the bezel with a performance indicator on each, so you can keep track of where you improve on a course. Inside is dual-frequency GPS, an AI Caddie mode that will make recommendations based on your performance, and special course maps.

The Huawei Watch Ultimate is otherwise the same as the Watch GT 5 Pro, but does come with a set of enhanced trail, hiking, and expedition modes to give it slightly wider appeal among those looking for a high-end outdoor smartwatch.

Huawei Watch D2

The Huawei Watch D2 is one of the most unusual smartwatches we’ve seen. It follows the first Watch D by providing cuff-based blood pressure monitoring, using a custom inflating band around your wrist. It’s unlike the algorithm-based blood pressure monitoring we’ve seem on smartwatches like the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, and is closer to a blood pressure cuff you wear around your upper arm.

The Watch D2 takes the feature a step further and provides automatic blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period, giving you a far clearer and more precise look at your blood pressure. The data collected can be exported and given to your health care provider, and even shared with family members in real time.

The air bag in the strap is covered in a soft, gel-like material for comfort and powered by a special Huawei-developed micro pump that’s 61% quieter than other devices, so it’s suitable for use overnight. The Watch D2’s design follows the Watch Fit 3’s design choices by looking just like the Apple Watch. It has a 1.82-inch screen, a heart rate sensor with ECG function, dual frequency GPS, and 80 workout modes. It can also make and receive calls too.

Prices and availability

The Huawei Watch GT 5 starts at 230 British pounds (about $305) while the Watch GT 5 Pro starts at 330 pounds (about $448). The Huawei Watch Ultimate costs considerably more at 750 pounds (about $995), while the Huawei Watch D2 costs 350 pounds (about $465). All are available starting September 19 through Huawei’s online store in the U.K. and other European regions.

In addition, Huawei has also introduced a subscription option for its Huawei Health app. It’s called Heath+, but rather than hide core features behind its paywall, Huawei has chosen to dedicate it to added value for those who want it. It includes special training modes, custom fitness plans, and relaxation and calming features too. It will cost 8 euros per month, which is around $9, and a three-month free trial is included with the new smartwatches."

We recently reported on the slew of Macs that are most likely on the way, but Apple’s been silent on the matter — until now. A stealthy line of code in the new macOS Sequoia update reveals that a new Mac mini might be in the works, and the confirmation fits right in with previous reports.

Let’s start with some context. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is readying a new Mac mini with the M4 and the M4 Pro chip. Aside from the chip upgrade, the 2024 Mac mini is said to be redesigned to be smaller than ever before, marking the first major change in the design of the mini PC in many years. It’s said to be around the same size as an Apple TV set-top box. To that end, we’ve heard that Apple might remove all of the USB-A ports on the Mac mini in an effort to make the PC even thinner.

What’s coming instead of those removed USB-A ports? USB-C ports, and a whole lot of them, too. Reports pointed to the new Mac mini sporting five USB-C ports in total, and that number ties perfectly to the confirmation found in macOS Sequoia.

Apple has confirmed that a new Mac mini is coming and it will come with 5 USB-C ports as reported by @markgurman pic.twitter.com/p5QBQmQkfk — Aaron (@aaronp613) September 16, 2024

As noted by Aaronp613 on X (formerly Twitter), there’s a short line of code in macOS Sequoia that directly refers to the new PC, mentioning an “Apple silicon Mac mini (5 Port).” Although there’s no mention of the M4 chip, the reference to using five ports is promising. Sure, it’s not the same as an official Apple announcement, but few sources are more solid than code found in Apple’s latest operating system for the Mac.

This could mean that some of the other reports will also prove to be true. Apple is said to be doing a lot in the way of both desktops and laptops, including a refresh for the entire MacBook Pro lineup. We’re expecting to see an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro equipped with the M4 chip, as well as two premium MacBook Pros, one 14-inch and one 16-inch, with the M4 Pro and the M4 Max. Apple is also said to be working on a new iMac.

It’s all up in the air until Apple actually unveils all of these rumored products, but until then, this hidden confirmation is as good as it gets. Apple is likely to host an event in October, this time focused on the Mac and the iPad, so stay tuned — we’ll keep you posted as soon as we learn more."

Between the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the latter seems like a bigger deal because of its ginormous 6.9-inch screen. But I’m telling you the iPhone 16 Pro should not be overlooked.

I’ve been using both of these new iPhone Pros side by side, and I think the regular iPhone 16 Pro is a better value. For $999, you get a bigger display than last year (6.3 vs 6.1 inches), the more powerful 5x zoom that used to be a Pro Max exclusive and an impressive battery life boost, based on our testing.

Otherwise, the iPhone 16 Pro has all the same goodies as the Pro Max, including the powerful A18 Pro chip, upgraded 48MP ultra wide camera and impressive video features like 4K 120 fps slow mo videos and Audio Mix for zapping background noise. Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools and the new Siri are promising based on early testing of the iOS 18.1 developer beta, but that won't officially arrive until October.

As you’ll see in my iPhone 16 Pro review, this is ounce-for-ounce one of the best phones you can buy and the best iPhone for power users on a budget — even if there’s not a truly “wow” feature yet for Apple Intelligence yet.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Specifications

iPhone 16 Pro review: Price and release date

The iPhone 16 Pro goes on sale September 20 and starts at $999 / £999 / AU$1,799 for 128GB of storage. It’s worth noting that the iPhone 16 Pro Max features 256GB of capacity in its base model.

The good news is that you can get 256GB of storage for $100 less than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and you get the same max storage option of 1TB for those willing to really splurge.

To get the best iPhone 16 Pro price, check out our roundup of the best iPhone 16 Pro deals .

iPhone 16 Pro review: Design

The iPhone 16 Pro is still a compact phone, but there’s a trade-off with getting a larger display. It’s now more of a mid-size phone now as opposed to a small phone, as the size and weight have grown.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

This handset measures 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches and weighs 7.03 ounces, compared to 5.77 x 2.78 x 0.32 inches and 6.6 ounces for the iPhone 15 Pro, so the new iPhone is taller and wider and just as thin, but there’s more heft to it.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

The good news is that the iPhone 16 Pro is still easy to use with one hand, as Apple made the bezels thinner. The design should be more durable, too, as Apple claims that the Ceramic Shield display is 50% tougher. Plus, the band is still made of titanium, which is more durable than aluminum.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

The iPhone 16 Pro colors aren’t very flashy compared to the regular iPhone 16. There’s White Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and the new Desert Titanium, which is like a soft rose gold. I prefer the Desert hue because it looks “new.”

iPhone 16 Pro review: Display

Don’t expect much new from the iPhone 16 display. The only real news beyond the size increase to 6.3 inches for this OLED screen is that it can get dimmer. The minimum is now just 1 nit (down from 2 nits on the iPhone 15 Pro ). I put the two phones side by side in a dark room, and I noticed the difference immediately.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

What’s the benefit? You can use your phone in bed without disturbing your partner, and if you’re using StandBy mode, the iPhone 16 Pro won’t be as bright when you’re using it overnight as an alarm clock.

Otherwise, you get the same 120Hz refresh rate on this ProMotion display, and the same max brightness. Apple claims a peak brightness of 2,000 nits outdoors and 1,600 nits for HDR content.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

We simulate outdoor conditions with a flashlight, and the iPhone 16 Pro reached 1,553 nits. That’s higher than the Galaxy S24 Ultra but way behind the Google Pixel 9 Pro .

iPhone 16 Pro review: Camera Control

Apple has added a new button to the iPhone 16 Pro, but it’s not technically a button. The Camera Control is a recessed capacitive switch that provides haptic feedback. Press once to launch right into the camera and press again to snap a photo. It’s simple and works well in landscape and portrait mode.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

I found it easy to launch straight into the camera, and I like that you can press and hold the Camera Control to record a video, though if you take your finger off the button the video stops. I wish you could customize that.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

The Camera Control has a lot of tricks, including the ability to zoom in and out by sliding your finger left and right on the button. And a soft double press launches a mini menu you can scroll through to tweak things like exposure, depth and choose Photographic Styles.

There’s a learning curve to Camera Control, but I’m glad that it’s an option. Plus, this frees up the Action Button on the left side of the iPhone 16 Pro for programming other shortcuts.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Cameras

The iPhone 16 Pro has a few key upgrades that I appreciated during my testing: there’s a sharper 48MP ultra wide camera, a faster 48MP main Fusion Camera with “zero shutter lag” and the 5x tetraprism zoom borrowed from the Pro Max series.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

In addition, Photographic Styles are integrated directly into the Camera and Photos app, so you can change Skin Undertones and the Mood effect of your photo on the fly. Plus, you can tweak it after the fact.

To test the iPhone 16 Pro’s faster performance I had my son take a photo of me shooting a jump shot side by side with the iPhone 15 Pro, and the result is a brighter and more detailed image.

Shooting subjects in motion using iPhone 16 Pro

How does the iPhone 16 Pro compare to the best camera phones ? I shot a number of pictures using the iPhone 16 Pro alongside the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL to find out.

I put the ultrawide camera to the test on the iPhone 16 Pro with this shot of a beach, and Apple comes out on top. The colors are more natural through the iPhone versus the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and Samsung’s pic looks distorted on the right side by the flowers.

The iPhone 16 Pro takes a crisp vivid photo of this Halloween sign with a rich orange in the foreground. But I give the Pixel 9 Pro XL credit for capturing more details in the shadows of the other decorations. Samsung does, too, but the S24 Ultra blows out other parts of the shot.

In this photo of peppers, the iPhone 16 Pro’s image is less saturated but I like how the ivory peppers have more depth. The S24 Ultra’s shot is a bit overexposed, although it’s more inviting at first glance.

So how good are the macro shots? I took this photo of a pink zinnia flower, purposely focusing on the petals on the left side of the frame. The Samsung shot is more on the purple side and less sharp in the petals.

I’m torn about the look of this portrait shot from the iPhone 16 Pro. I look brighter through the iPhone but also a bit washed out. There’s a green tinge to the image from the S24 Ultra, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the most well balanced shot.

I tried something a bit trickier with this comparison of a string of lights outside a restaurant. The iPhone 16 Pro is my favorite here because of the level of detail when you zoom in, though the Pixel 9 Pro XL does a better job with the definition in the bricks. Samsung’s pic is good but a bit fuzzier.

To test the iPhone 16 Pro’s 12MP selfie camera I put it up against the Pixel 9 Pro XL and I slightly prefer Google’s shot. My black shirt looks crisper and the green bushes behind me look brighter.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Video

The video on the iPhone 16 Pro gets a boost as you can now record at 4K and 120fps (up from 60fps). So video will not only look smoother on the 120Hz display, you can adjust the playback speed on the fly to get dramatic-looking slo-mo videos.

I tried this out by recording a ping pong match in Bryant Park, and it’s remarkable how sharp the footage remained as I dropped the playback speed all the way down to 20%. You can have a lot of fun with this feature.

So what about the video quality? I filmed a fountain on a sunny day with the iPhone 16 Pro, Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the results were mixed. When zoomed out I preferred the natural colors of the iPhone on the flowers on the left side of the frame and the trees in the background, and the water looked super sharp. However, both the Samsung and Google phones delivered better detail in the stone and more contrast when I zoomed in at 5x. It took a second for the iPhone to focus.

In low light the iPhone 16 Pro captured footage that looked a bit dimmer than the Galaxy S24 Ultra of a fountain as I panned around up to a large clock. But once I zoomed in, the S24 Ultra’s footage turned dark and lost detail; the iPhone 16 Pro’s clip was more consistent at 5x zoom.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Apple Intelligence

“Hey, Siri. Are you smart yet?” Apple Intelligence isn’t officially coming to the iPhone 16 series until October, but I was able to try out some of the features ahead of its official launch as part of the iOS 18.1 developer preview.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

Writing Tools can be fairly helpful. I used it to summarize a long note in the Apple Notes app and it came up with a useful summary. I also had fun with Writing Tools trying to rewrite an email I purposely wrote in a rude tone, choosing the professional option. And the result was indeed closer to what I would usually send.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

I also used Apple Intelligence to look up how to do various things on the iPhone and got back step-by-step instructions for how to screen record on your iPhone. So you’ll definitely spend less time looking up how-tos online.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

On the Photos front, my favorite Apple Intelligence feature is Memory Movie. You can give the Photos app a prompt like “Beach memories through the years with an upbeat soundtrack” and you’ll see the AI go to work sifting through all your photos and videos. And the end result was pretty satisfying, fittingly ending with a sunset pic.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

While it's overdue, I appreciate that the iPhone 16 Pro has a Clean Up button, which is basically Google’s Magic Eraser on iOS. Apple's version of the feature is smart enough to identify objects or subjects you might want to remove and it works quickly. But the feature struggled in some cases to completely erase what I didn’t want in the frame.

Siri is definitely the biggest upgrade with Apple Intelligence. It’s a lot more conversational and forgiving of mistakes as you speak. For example, I was able to correct a timer from 10 minutes to 5 minutes on the fly and Siri got it right.

iPhone 16 Pro Max shown in hand

The new Siri in Apple Intelligence is also better with follow-up questions. For example, I could ask about the weather today and then say “How about the rest of the week” and I got an extended forecast. Siri was also smart enough to answer “Who do the Yankees play next?” and “What are the odds?” in succession, though it couldn’t tell me who the starting pitcher was. I got Safari links instead.

Another plus is that you can talk to Siri just by typing. You tap the bottom of the iPhone 16 Pro to enter your query, which comes in handy when you can’t talk.

Siri is definitely getting better, but it doesn’t have that “wow” factor that you'll experience with Gemini Live voice or GPT-40 voice , where it feels like you're having a real conversation with a chatbot.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Performance

The iPhone 16 Pro packs Apple’s new A18 Pro chip built on second-generation 3-namoeter tech, as well as 8GB of RAM. Based on our testing, it is indeed the fastest chip around, but not on every test.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

When I played Resident Evil Village, I was scared (in a good way) as I made my way down a snowy path and stumbled upon some dead birds. The graphics are console-grade. I also got to play the Infinity Nikki game, which was in beta, and the lighting and water effects were very impressive.

On Geekbench, which measures overall performance, the iPhone 16 Pro is 50% faster than the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip on single core and 15% higher on multi-core performance. The Pixel 9 Pro series is well behind.

To test video editing performance we use Adobe Premiere Rush and time how long it takes to transcode a 4K clip to 1080p. The new iPhone 16 Pro needed just 21 seconds, which is twice as fast as the S24 Ultra.

On the graphics front, the iPhone 16 Pro features a 6-core GPU, compared to 5 cores for the regular iPhone 16 models. Apple says you should get 20% faster performance than the iPhone 15 Pro.

On the 3DMark Solar Bay graphics test, which has support for ray tracing, the iPhone 16 Pro was 22% faster than the iPhone 15 Pro. However, that’s still 18% behind the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which also delivered higher frame rates on the test.

The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a new internal design with a graphite-clad aluminum substructure that’s supposed to result in 20% better sustained performance. To test this claim we ran the 3DMark Wilfe Life Stress Test for 20 minutes.

The iPhone 16 Pro turned in a stability score of 66%. It hit a higher overall loop score than iPhone 16 Pro max but had a bigger drop-off. The Galaxy S24 Ultra’s score was worse at 60.4%. Interestingly, the iPhone 16 Pro Max turned in a stronger stability score of 84%, which is better than the 75% from the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Battery life and charging

The iPhone 16 Pro gets a big battery life boost, thanks to a larger battery and other efficiencies. On the Tom’s Guide battery life test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness, the new iPhone 16 Pro lasted 14 hours and 7 minutes, which is a big jump from the 10:53 from the iPhone 15 Pro, and enough to just crack our list of the best phone battery life .

The Google Pixel 9 Pro lasted 13:37, so it was a bit behind. The larger Galaxy S24 Ultra endured for 16:45.

The bad news is that the iPhone 16 Pro has the same 20W charging speeds as before, so it wasn’t a surprise to see it get to 56% capacity in 30 minutes. The Google Pixel 9 Pro’s 45W charger was worse at 49% but the S24 Ultra reached 71% in the same time.

Despite reports that the iPhone 16 Pro supports 45W charging, we did not see a difference in our testing. The good news is that MagSafe wireless charging sees a jump from 15W to 25W, if you’re using a 30W adapter.

iPhone 16 Pro review: iOS 18

Apple intelligence isn’t the only major upgrade in iOS 18. As you’ll see in our iOS 18 review, it makes the iPhone a lot more customizable. You can arrange icons however you like on the home screen, and you now get three screens of shortcuts in Control Center that you can tweak how you see fit.

With the Photos app, iOS 18 makes it easier to find images in your library by topic and you can also change the look and feel of the app to your liking. Other iOS 18 upgrades include a dedicated Passwords app for security, several Messages improvements (like scheduling messages and RCS support) and the ability to share money with Tap to Cash.

iPhone 16 Pro review: Verdict

Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro is arguably the best flagship phone under $1,000. You get the same excellent cameras as the iPhone 16 Pro Max for $200 less and I think the screen is big enough at 6.3 inches while being easy to use with one hand.

iPhone 16 Pro shown held in hand

I also like the improved battery life, handy Camera Control and compelling Audio Mix feature for videos. The Apple Intelligence capabilities — such as Writing Tools, the new Siri and Cleanup — show promise, but some of the more exciting features like ChatGPT integration, Image Playground and the Google Lens-like Visual Intelligence are coming later.

In terms of the competition, I think the Galaxy S24 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro have more compelling AI features right now. But I prefer the camera system from the iPhone in many cases and the extra performance from its A18 Pro chip.

Should you upgrade to the iPhone 16 Pro? If you have an iPhone 13 Pro or older phone I’d say yes, and if you have an iPhone 14 Pro, I’d say wait to see how well Apple Intelligence works once it fully rolls out before you buy."

Apple users complain that iOS 18 is ‘killing’ their iPhone batteries —what to do if you’re affected

Apple users are bitter over the latest software update, claiming their device performance has taken a drastic hit.

Overly zealous customers eager to upgrade to the new iOS 18 — released on Monday ahead of the iPhone 16 launch — are met with battery troubles, claiming the operating system drains the battery life of their smartphones.

Already on X, users moaned that they “regret updating” since the update is supposedly “killing” their phone battery, making jokes about their devices overheating after installing.

“I updated my software to IOS 18 and my battery percentage has dropped so fast,” one X user wrote, per Daily Mail. “It’s been an hour since I charged it at 80% and didn’t used [sic] it that much at this time yet my phone percentage now is at 67%.”

While a select few claimed the update had no effect on their battery, this is standard fare for any iPhone update it seems — with iOS 17, disgruntled Apple fans grumbled about the same battery life issues — and, on the bright side, completely normal.

On Reddit, iOS 18 beta testers show new features — and some note battery life impacts — of the new operating system. ant_t99/Reddit

“Installing a new OS on an iPhone triggers a lot of stuff to go on in the background, from indexing to recalibrating the battery, and this can go on for hours or even days,” ZDNet researcher Adrian Kingsley-Hughes told Daily Mail.

“Not only does this consume power, but the battery recalibration can give the impression that the battery is draining more rapidly when in fact it isn’t.”

According to ZDNet, concerned smartphone users can try rebooting their devices and updating applications in the interim in an attempt to remedy the issue. The site also recommends turning down screen brightness, resetting network settings, using “Dark Mode” or turning off Wi-Fi Assist, a function that automatically switches to cellular data when Wi-Fi is too slow.

Poor battery life could indicate degrading battery health — which can be easily checked in the iPhone’s Settings app under the tab “Battery” — and a battery replacement could fix the problem.

Ultimately, the issue should resolve itself over time after the update is completed. Sometimes, users have to wait until another software update is available for bugs to be fixed.

The highly anticipated iOS 18 update allows users more customization capabilities, abandoning the grid layout of the home screen and letting users place apps wherever they want and even change the color and size of the icons.

Additionally, the Photos app underwent a revamp, with an updated layout with new collection options. The Mail app features new ways to organize inboxes, and a new feature in Safari allows users to get rid of unwanted ads and pop-ups for a more streamlined browsing experience.

The operating system also has a new Passwords app and updated privacy features, as well as new Apple Intelligence functions that utilize AI.

While not all iPhones are compatible with iOS 18, according to Apple, all devices from the iPhone XR and later should be able to install and use the latest operating system."

Apple‘s hardware is known for its innovative design, longevity, and relatively high price tag, but the company hasn’t participated in any big sales or offers for several years. If you want a deal on Apple’s gear, you’ll have to look elsewhere.

More from Rolling Stone

Luckily, most major retailers have begun offering end of year sales on Apple’s slate of products. These are new, unopened products — not deals on refurbished or open box stock. If you know where to shop, you’ll never have to pay full price for a MacBook, AirPods, iPad, or Apple Watch again.

What Are the Best Apple Deals?

We’ve rounded up the best Apple deals you can get on their newest gear below. Keep in mind that Apple’s products are always in high demand, and global supply chain issues mean there’ll be even fewer items in stock than usual. If you see a deal you like, now’s the time to take advantage of it.

While Apple.com doesn’t do a specific sale, you can find a number of Apple deals on Amazon right now. Prime members will also be able to get free shipping on their purchases, saving you a few extra dollars online. We’ve also included a few deals from Target and Walmart.

We’ll update this article regularly as sales events come and go, but the deals and prices below were active at the time of publication.

Soon after, as it usually does following new iPhone announcements, Apple retired several older iPhones.

On Monday, Apple announced the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max — adding to the existing lineup that includes the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and third-generation iPhone SE. To make room for the newest iPhones, Apple is no longer selling the iPhone 13, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

The discontinued iPhone models will still be available at third-party retailers for a while. In some cases, they may be sold at substantial discounts. Even though Apple no longer offers these phones for purchase, they will continue to receive iOS and security updates for a long time. For example, Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 update will support iPhones starting with the 2018 models, including the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR.

Before purchasing an older phone, it’s important to note that Apple Intelligence will only be supported on the iPhone 16 series and the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. It will not work on any other older iPhone models. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max also include larger displays.

The iPhone 16 series will be available for sale starting this Friday, September 13, with the first orders being shipped one week later on September 20. These phones offer several new features, including all-new chips, a new Camera Control feature, new colors, and more. Camera improvements are also coming to all four models.

In addition to the new iPhones, Apple has announced the Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4, as well as slight improvements to the Apple Ultra 2, AirPods Max, and AirPods Pro 2."

People then mock up images of them watching it on the worst, least-immersive devices possible, from iPods to Game Boys. It came to mind during the iPhones 16 launch event, Apple said its new models have CPUs that can challenge “even high-end desktop PCs” and “desktop-class GPU architecture.” And it made me wonder if anyone is actually playing AAA games on a 6-inch smartphone for any real length of time?

Look, we all know this is just Apple flexing the power of its homegrown silicon, given even its A-Series SOCs run almost as fast as a flagship Intel CPU. We also all know that if you tried to run your iPhone with the same load as you could put on a desktop, you’d quickly burn it out. (Case in point, Resident Evil Village caused GamesHub’s iPhone 15 Pro to run “uncomfortably hot” and burned through 30 percent of its battery life in an hour.) All of that power is great for the sort of tasks an iPhone needs to do which are only demanding in short bursts. Processing audio and video, or the odd blast of generative AI (when it arrives) that Apple is understandably proud of being able to do on-device.

But this emphasis on raw power suggests the company has lost sight of what the iPhone is for, and what its limitations are. Yes, I’m sure some people love playing Death Stranding on the bus into school, or work. I’m sure there are some people who will try and use the Notes app to write their term papers, and one or two filmmakers who will use the iPhone instead of a Red, but those can’t be massive constituencies of the overall user base.

It’s hard to see people using their iPhone to get the sort of Serious Work done that you’d need a better user interface to achieve. iPhones are great for photography, social media, communication, casual gaming, but they can’t be a comprehensive replacement for a laptop or games console. Well, you can use them for those purposes, but I’m not sure anyone should.

Another telling example was the demo showing a person using Voice Notes to record a new vocal over a backing track they’d previously recorded. It’s a great way to show the iPhones 16’s ability to isolate audio even when the sources are so close together. Apple added the feature to Voice Notes because it has seen user feedback that it’s become a valuable tool in a musician’s arsenal. But it’s also something of an own-goal given Apple’s own multi-track recording platform, Garageband, has been left (deservedly) ignored and unloved for the last decade.

I suspect all of this points to the fact that Apple, with its key strengths of merging hardware and software, has run out of worlds to conquer in the former. After all, as glorious as the new iPhone is, the upgrades have been incremental for a long while now. As fancy and high-tech as the new camera shutter button is, it’s not as if adding a dedicated button for capture is groundbreaking — I had one of those on my Sony Ericsson K750i . I’m also curious how many iPhone users actually harness those extra camera features (like adjusting the focal length, or shooting in RAW) when they’re snapping clips for TikTok. And if you, like me, don’t really value Apple Intelligence, or just think those features aren’t really compelling, then there’s little reason to rush out and upgrade.

It doesn’t help that I was also reminded of what Steve Jobs said in 2010, describing personal computers as “trucks” whose prominence would fall as people switched to the “cars” of phones and tablets. Trucks were go-anywhere, do-anything tools that were vital a century or more ago but were phased out when people started using more specific tools suited to their needs. The iPhone 16 launch event, however, felt like Apple showing everyone that it’d managed to cram a Big Rig engine into a Porsche.

At its ""It's Glowtime"" event on Sept. 9, Apple unveiled the new Apple Watch Series 10, new AirPods, and, yes, the iPhone 16 series. Alongside those new iPhones, Apple is also launching its latest iPhone operating system, iOS 18.

iOS 18 was announced at WWDC back in June, teasing a series of new features. These include new ways to organize your Home Screen, a new customizable Control Center, and Apple Intelligence, the headline feature.

Beta testers have been able to try out most of these features for some time now — but with a public release, you'll finally get them for yourself. Here’s what you need to know.

iOS 18 release date

Apple always releases new versions of iOS alongside its new iPhones — and outside of the beta testing program, you can download and install iOS 18 for yourself on Sept. 16, a few days before the new iPhones are released on Sept. 20.

When you do, though, it won’t offer all of the features that Apple announced in June. Some smart home features, for example, are reserved for iOS 18.1, which doesn’t have an official release date yet, so you’ll have to wait a little to try it out. Then, there’s Apple Intelligence, which has its own release timeline.

What’s new in iOS 18?

iOS 18 brings with it a series of great new features. Many of these relate to customization, allowing users to personalize their devices.

Apart from Apple Intelligence, perhaps the headline feature is one that ex-Android users have been asking for—a more customizable Home Screen. With iOS 18, you’ll be able to place apps wherever you want on the screen (within the grid, of course) instead of having them arranged from left to right, top to bottom, at all times. Additionally, you can set new Dark and Tinted Home Screen options, which bring different colors to your Home Screen wallpaper and apps.

The Control Center is also becoming more customizable. In iOS 18, you can create and customize multiple pages of the Control Center and more easily place and resize your existing controls. So, you could have a whole page dedicated to smart home controls, or you could place only the controls you care about on one screen in the exact position that works for you.

Plenty of Apple’s first-party apps are getting new features as well. iMessage will let you use any emoji as a Tapback reaction, and you’ll be able to format text with underlines and italics — not to mention RCS support, which brings better cross-platform messaging. The Photos app is getting an all-new single-page design, and you’ll now be able to lock apps behind Face ID — so you can better secure sensitive information. Lastly, passwords are moving out of the Settings app and into their own Passwords app.

Apple Event 2024 Recap

Apple Intelligence

Apple Intelligence is perhaps the most important ""feature"" of iOS 18. It is just the name that Apple calls its bundle of new AI features. Unfortunately, accessing these features isn’t quite as simple as downloading iOS 18. The very first Apple Intelligence features won’t be available until iOS 18.1, which is expected sometime towards the end of October, based on previous iOS iterations.

SEE ALSO: iPhone 16 is getting Apple Intelligence — and it's free

Even when iOS 18.1 is released, it won’t have all of the Apple Intelligence features that Apple announced in June. The currently available beta version of iOS 18.1 has new writing tools that can generate and summarize text, suggested replies in Messages, phone call recording and transcripts, and notification summaries for both the Messages and Mail apps. These features will almost certainly be available in iOS 18.1, unless Apple runs into a hitch and decides to pull them, which is unlikely.

There are features that no one outside of Apple has tested yet, but these will likely be held until a later iOS 18 release. These features include some headliners, like Image Playground, Genmoji for generated emoji, Siri enhancements (with the ChatGPT integration), and on-screen awareness. These are some of the most significant features of Apple Intelligence, but Apple is taking things slow with AI. The company has even said that some features won't be released until 2025, though it did highlight that ChatGPT integration would be available by the end of 2024, so other Siri enhancements will likely be out by then, too.

Again, though, features could be delayed if Apple wants to hold them longer.

Which devices will support iOS 18?

iOS 18 will be available on all of the same devices that support iOS 17, which is great news for those with a slightly older phone. However, not all of these models will get Apple Intelligence. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (along with all iPhone 16 devices) get the new AI features.

Here's a list of devices that will get iOS 18.

iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max

iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max

Apple unveiled a quartet of iPhones on Monday, including the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. As expected, the updates are largely iterative. The standard models now have the programmable Action button from last year's Pro series, slightly improved battery life and an updated camera module that's stacked vertically instead of diagonally.

The Pro phones, meanwhile, feature bigger displays with slimmer bezels, improved battery life and a handful of camera upgrades, including a 5x optical zoom for the smaller Pro and a sharper ultrawide camera. The standard models run on Apple's new A18 silicon, while the Pro models, fittingly, use a faster and more efficient chip called the A18 Pro.

The most notable hardware change across the board might be a new touch-sensitive ""Camera Control"" button that makes capturing photos and video a little more DSLR-like. Mostly, though, these phones don't look to be massive departures from the iPhone 15s before them. Much of Apple's sales pitch will come down to how helpful its ""Apple Intelligence"" AI tools are out in the wild.

We already have a hands-on preview for the iPhone 16 Pro up on the site, and we'll have full reviews for the entire iPhone 16 lineup in the near future. But if you're thinking about pre-ordering right away, we've broken down how the new iPhone 16 Pro compares to two of its most prominent rivals in the $1,000 price bracket, the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24+, on the spec sheet. Per usual, raw specs won't tell the full story — you'd probably buy an iPhone because you want iOS and an Android phone because you prefer Android — but if you're wondering what a $1,000 smartphone gets you in 2024, here's how Apple's latest handset stacks up.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Google Pixel 9 Pro Samsung Galaxy S24+ Pricing (MSRP) $999 (128GB), $1,099 (256GB), $1,299 (512GB), $1,499 (1TB) $999 (128GB), $1,099 (256GB), $1,219 (512GB), $1,449 (1TB) $1,000 (256GB), $1,120 (512GB) Dimensions 5.9 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches 6.2 x 3 x 0.3 inches Weight 7.03 ounces 7 ounces 6.9 ounces Screen size 6.3 inches 6.3 inches 6.7 inches Screen resolution 1,206 x 2,622 (460 ppi) 1,280 x 2,856 (495 ppi) 1,440 x 3,120 (512 ppi) Screen type OLED Up to 120Hz (1-120Hz) Up to 2,000 nits (peak brightness) Ceramic Shield LTPO OLED Up to 120Hz (1-120Hz) Up to 3,000 nits (peak brightness) Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 Dynamic AMOLED 2X Up to 120Hz (1-120Hz) Up to 2,600 nits (peak brightness) Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 SoC Apple A18 Pro (6-core) Google Tensor G4 (8-core) NA/China: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (8-core) Int'l: Samsung Exynos 2400 (10-core) RAM Not specified 16GB RAM 12GB RAM Battery ""Up to 27"" hours video playback 4,700 mAh ""24+ hours"" with mixed usage 4,900mAh ""Up to 29"" hours video playback Charging Wired: not specified 25W wireless (with MagSafe charger; up to 15W with Qi2 chargers) 27W wired 21W wireless (with Pixel Stand; up to 12W with other Qi chargers) 45W wired 15W wireless Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB (1TB only available with Obsidian model) 256GB, 512GB Rear camera Main (""Fusion""): 48 MP, f/1.78 Ultrawide: 48 MP, f/2.2, 120° FOV Telephoto: 12 MP, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Main: 50 MP, f/1.68, 82° FOV Ultrawide: 48 MP, f/1.7, 123° FOV Telephoto: 48 MP, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Main: 50 MP, f/1.8, 85° FOV Ultrawide: 12MP, f/2.2, 120° FOV Telephoto: 10MP, f/2.4, 3x optical zoom Front camera 12 MP, f/1.9 42 MP, f/2.2, 103° FOV 12 MP, f/2.2, 80° FOV Video capture Rear: 4K at 24/25/30/60/100/120 fps, 1080p up to 240 fps Front: 4K at 24/24/30/60 fps, 1080p up to 120 fps Rear: 8K at 30 fps, 4K at 24/30/60 fps, 1080p up to 240 fps Front: 4K at 30/60 fps Rear: 8K at 24/30 fps, 4K at 30/60 fps, 1080p up to 240 fps Front: 4K at 30/60 fps Water and dust resistance rating IP68 IP68 IP68 Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 7 Wi-Fi 7 Wi-Fi 6e Bluetooth Bluetooth 5.3 Bluetooth 5.3 Bluetooth 5.3 OS iOS 18 Android 14 Android 14 Colors and finish Glass front, glass back, titanium frame Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium Glass front, glass back, aluminum frame Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, Obsidian Glass front, glass back, aluminum frame Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, Marble Gray, Jade Green, Sandstone Orange, Sapphire Blue

However, Apple did reveal the largest Apple Watch display ever on the Series 10 wearable. The device is also thinner, delivering the bigger-but-slimmer update the company loves to give new devices. It's lighter too, so all three of the design changes should make the wearable more comfy to... wear. And of course, the new display will be a key selling point for this updated model.

That display is the standout update to me. The panel is said to be 40 percent brighter when viewed at an angles, which will make it so much easier to see Watch info at a glance. I tried on the Series 10 in the demo area here at Apple Park in both the 46mm and 42mm sizes. The larger of the two isn't that much of burden for me as I'm rocking a 45mm Series 7 on the daily. Still, the OLED display is a massive upgrade over what I'm used to, and it will offer better performance over recent Apple Watches too. I also got a look at that screen update feature, which lets you see time and other info even when the display is in ambient mode.

Apple Watch Series 10 (Billy Steele for Engadget)

In addition to the new display, both it and the Apple Watch case have more rounded angles. Combine that with new finishes (hello, jet black!) and you've got the biggest update to Apple's wearable since the Series 4 in terms of design. There are also a host of new features we weren't able to test in the demo area, like the depth gauge and water temperature sensor, but we did get a brief look at the upcoming sleep apnea tool in Apple Health.

Here, Apple Watch will monitor your sleep for breathing disturbances. Like other sleep metrics, you'll see data for the current month, path six months and previous year, so you'll be aware of any changes over time. Of course, the app will alert you if you might need to see a doctor, and it will offer all of the logged data for you to share when you do. Millions of people suffer from sleep apnea, so being able to detect the signs of the condition without time-consuming sleep testing will certainly be a welcome addition to Apple's suite of health-tracking tools with Watch Series 10.

The main aesthetic update to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a new black color option. And while there's isn't a ton to say there, I will note that it looks very nice. Plus, it provides some contrast for those people who didn't care for the lighter silver option that was available before now.

However, Apple did reveal the largest Apple Watch display ever on the Series 10 wearable. The device is also thinner, delivering the bigger-but-slimmer update the company loves to give new devices. It's lighter too, so all three of the design changes should make the wearable more comfy to... wear. And of course, the new display will be a key selling point for this updated model.

That display is the standout update to me. The panel is said to be 40 percent brighter when viewed at an angles, which will make it so much easier to see Watch info at a glance. I tried on the Series 10 in the demo area here at Apple Park in both the 46mm and 42mm sizes. The larger of the two isn't that much of burden for me as I'm rocking a 45mm Series 7 on the daily. Still, the OLED display is a massive upgrade over what I'm used to, and it will offer better performance over recent Apple Watches too. I also got a look at that screen update feature, which lets you see time and other info even when the display is in ambient mode.

In addition to the new display, both it and the Apple Watch case have more rounded angles. Combine that with new finishes (hello, jet black!) and you've got the biggest update to Apple's wearable since the Series 4 in terms of design. There are also a host of new features we weren't able to test in the demo area, like the depth gauge and water temperature sensor, but we did get a brief look at the upcoming sleep apnea tool in Apple Health.

Here, Apple Watch will monitor your sleep for breathing disturbances. Like other sleep metrics, you'll see data for the current month, path six months and previous year, so you'll be aware of any changes over time. Of course, the app will alert you if you might need to see a doctor, and it will offer all of the logged data for you to share when you do. Millions of people suffer from sleep apnea, so being able to detect the signs of the condition without time-consuming sleep testing will certainly be a welcome addition to Apple's suite of health-tracking tools with Watch Series 10.

The main aesthetic update to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a new black color option. And while there's isn't a ton to say there, I will note that it looks very nice. Plus, it provides some contrast for those people who didn't care for the lighter silver option that was available before now.

Once again, we are treated to the same fundamental design and familiar colors.

Last year’s iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max were among the best phones released last year. How do this year’s models stack up? Are they worth upgrading to? Let’s break it all down.

Buy at AppleApple claims the next-gen screen protection on the iPhone 15 Pro and its Max trim is stronger than the first-gen Ceramic Shield display protection. The most notable hardware change, however, is the new physical shutter button that also lets users customize various camera features for quick access.

This button supports tap as well as slide gestures, thanks to a capacitive surface and a taptic engine underneath for vibration feedback. Aside from capturing pictures, it also pulls up a quick control slider in the camera viewfinder to adjust metrics such as exposure, zoom, and depth of field. In the coming months, Apple will update the camera app to add two-stage shutter click functionality.

Apple

Apple says the new iPhones have been designed from the ground up to get the best out of Apple Intelligence, the suite of generative AI features that includes everything from writing tools to a more conversational Siri with deeper app integration.

The build now relies on a Grade 5 Titanium with a sandblasted texture. In addition to improving the thermal architecture, Apple also claims that the new Pro models offer the “best iPhone battery life ever.” Apple has also bumped up the screen size, putting a 6.3-inch panel on the iPhone 16 Pro and a 6.9-inch display on the Max variant. Apple has also enhanced the charging pace, taking it to 25-watt with a MagSafe wireless adapter.

Powering the iPhone 16 Pro duo is the new A18 Pro processor, built atop an updated 3-nanometer processor. The company says it borrowed tech from the Apple silicon powering its Mac lineup to boost the graphics output, bringing a sizable improvement in raw performance as well as power efficiency.

Apple

It delivers a 17% lift in memory bandwidth, a 2x boost at hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and up to 20% improvement in sustained performance. The 6-core architecture includes two performance cores and four efficiency cores, surpassing the A17 Pro’s raw performance by around a 15% margin.

The most notable software-side upgrade is Visual Intelligence, which is tiled to the Camera Control button. Think of it as Google Lens, but supercharged with the new Siri AI chops, as well as seamless offloading to ChatGPT for more complex queries. Visual Intelligence works in the same vein as GPT-4o vision capabilities, but with the added benefit of local integration with tools such as Calendar.

Apple

Apple has kept the 48-megapixel primary camera, but has upgraded the ultrawide camera to a 48-megapixel sensor while keeping the telephoto camera at a 12-megapixel resolution. Notably, the 5x optical zoom capability enabled by the tetra prism lenses architecture is now available on the iPhone 16 Pro and the Max version as well.

In terms of camera capabilities, the the most notable one is the ability to shoot 4K videos at 120 frames per second (fps), complete with the convenience of ProRes and LOG capture directly on external storage. Notably, it can be used for both normal capture as well as slo-mo video recording.

Apple claims that users can now perform professional-grade color grading on individual frames of 4K video recorded at 120 fps in Dolby Vision.

Apple also is making the best of the onboard studio quality mics for vlogging professionals. Take for example Audio Mix, which apparently does the same thing with sound signals as Cinematic Mode does with focal adjustment in videos during post-edits. The new tool lets users modify audio tracks after filming, enabling them to isolate and enhance a speaker’s voice, simulate a professional studio recording environment, or separate vocal and ambient sounds for a surround sound experience. Apple is throwing wind noise reduction into the mix. Thanks to Apple Intelligence, Siri will also lend a helping hand with image and video editing.

Surprisingly, the asking prices remains unchanged. The iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while the Max version goes up for $1,199 in the U.S. Preorders kick off on Friday, and shipments will commence on September 20, 2024.

Apple Intelligence is expected to be the star of the Apple event this year, like it was at WWDC in June, despite the many anticipated hardware reveals like new Apple Watches, AirPods and Macs. Broadcasting live from its headquarters in Cupertino, Apple’s “Glowtime” event kicked off at 10 a.m. PT, and you can still watch the livestream here.

Whether Monday's reveals end up inspiring or delaying a “supercycle” of customers adopting the new iPhone 16 lineup remains to be seen, but Apple’s focus on AI as a core part of its sales pitch moving forward is clear. We’ll keep this post updated as the Apple event continues, and as reports emerge from the demo rooms and briefings following the event.

iPhone 16

As no surprise, the iPhone 16 ""has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,"" in the words of Apple CEO Tim Cook, and the tweaked designs and new colors were revealed at the Apple event. The new iPhone 16 lineup comes with a camera control along the side, which allows for physical interactions to access camera features, along with the new A18 chip Apple claims makes the iPhone 16 30 percent faster than the iPhone 15. Catch up on our ongoing iPhone 16 updates here.

Apple Watch Series 10

overview of Apple Watch Series 10 features

Apple kicked things off with reveals on the Watch for the line’s tenth anniversary, rolling out a series of updates within the Apple Watch Series 10 line, including a tweaked design with more rounded corners and an updated aspect ratio, with Apple’s first wide-angle OLED screens. The Series 10’s display is up to 40 percent brighter when viewed at an angle, and is the thinnest Apple Watch yet at 9.7mm and up to 10 percent lighter than the previous models. Unsurprisingly, AI featured in the Apple Watch Series 10 reveal, with a new photos watch face using AI to curate the photos shown on the display, and translation tools using machine learning to improve output.

Apple Watches are also getting an update to detect sleep apnea, which is pending FDA clearance. The feature will come to both the Series 10 and Series 9 watches. The Apple Watch Series 10 will start at $399, and it launches September 20.

Read more on the Apple Watch Series 10 here.

Apple Watch Ultra

Apple has long touted the Ultra as a device for fitness aficionados, boasting custom workouts, running track detection, bike rides as live activities and so on. And after a lead-up to a reveal, Apple dropped that there won't be a Apple Watch Ultra 3 yet, instead announcing a new satin black color for the Ultra 2.

AirPods 4

AirPods 4

Apple claims the new AirPods 4 are the ""most comfortable AirPods ever,"" with a new A2 chip under the tweaked design. Personalized Spatial Audio is coming to the AirPods 4, along with the addition of machine learning for Siri to pick up head shakes as nods as responses to prompts. The new AirPods 4 will also be available September 20, starting at $129 with active noise cancellation added for the $179 tier. Get the full rundown on the AirPods updates here.

AirPods Pro 2

AirPods Pro Hearing Test

Three points were highlighted for AirPods Pro 2 updates: prevention, awareness and assistance. For prevention, hearing protection will be added and on by default for passive noise reduction, managed through machine learning. For awareness, Apple is adding a ""clinically validated"" hearing test that owners can take at any time.

And then for assistance, hearing aid features are launching for those whose hearing tests identify them as potentially benefiting from hearing assisting features. Apple claims that they expect clearance from the FDA on these features ""soon,"" with updates expected to come to iOS in the fall.

Like clockwork, Apple has revealed this year's iPhone lineup, which is anchored by the iPhone 16 and its larger sibling, the iPhone 16 Plus. Apple has made some alterations to the external design, but the company’s main focus this year is on Apple Intelligence, with the new phones designed from the ground up to support that.

There are a few notable changes to the exteriors of both devices this year. First, the rear camera array is arranged vertically on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a pill-shaped bump. These lenses will now support spatial video recording — in other words, the 3D footage that you can view using a Vision Pro headset. You'll be able to take spatial photos too. There's also support for 4K video capture at 60 frames per second with Dolby Vision.

Spatial photo seen through Apple Vision Pro (Apple)

Apple is doing something else interesting with the camera array in the iPhone 16. One camera seems to combine a 48MP main lens with a 2x telephoto lens in what's called a ""Fusion camera."" The other is a 12MP Ultra Wide camera. This now has an f/2.2 aperture, which is an improvement on the previous f/2.4 aperture. As such, that means that Apple will offer a macro mode for the base iPhone models for the first time, so folks who don't opt for an iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max should be able to take better close-up photos.

Second, the Action button that debuted on last year's Pro models has arrived on the lower-end models. This button, which replaces the mute switch, is customizable. You might set it up to activate the flashlight or a Voice Memos recording. It can trigger Shortcuts and, starting in iOS 18, you can use it to adjust a Control Center setting. You can set up the Action button to have different functions at different times of day.

iPhone 16 Camera Control (Apple)

Third, there's another new Camera Control button that's dedicated to capturing photos and videos, so you won't have to tap your display, press one of the volume buttons or use a remote trigger to take a snap or a recording. Clicking the button opens the Camera app. The touch-sensitive button works in a similar fashion to the capture button on a DSLR camera — lightly press to focus on a subject, then fully press to take a photo. You can hold it down to start recording a video.

You'll be able to adjust camera settings (such as the zoom) by sliding your finger back and forth on the touch-sensitive button. This could well be a game-changer for iPhone-focused photographers.

The Camera Control button also works with a new Google Lens-style visual intelligence feature that's coming to the iPhone 16 later this year. For instance, you an point your phone at a new restaurant, click the Camera Control and find out details about the menu and opening hours.

Apple Visual Intelligence (Apple)

The other key upgrades are on the interior. Apple says there's a new thermal system made from 100 percent recycled aluminum to replace the copper one from previous devices. That should help reduce overheating and improve temperature regulation – Apple says you’ll get 30 percent higher sustained performance while gaming. In addition, there’s support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, which is said to deliver five times higher frame rates than with software-accelerated ray-tracing.

Some games that were previously only supported on the iPhone 15 Pro (at least in terms of phones) will be available on iPhone 16. Those include Assassin's Creed Mirage and several Resident Evil titles.

Apple Intelligence will be powered by the all-new A18 chipset. It has a CPU that's up to 30 percent faster than the one found in the iPhone 15, and a GPU that's up to 40 percent faster. There's an upgraded neural engine that is said to be up to two times faster for machine learning. As expected, Apple Intelligence features will start rolling out in the US in English in October, before expanding to some other countries in December and other languages in 2025.

As part of the Apple Intelligence shift, a new Siri experience is coming into play. This isn't a huge surprise as it was part of the iOS 18 preview when we got our first look at WWDC in June. Not only does Apple claim that Siri will have deeper understanding of language and users' personal context, the voice assistant will have a new glowing interface. That's what the iPhone event's ""It's Glowtime"" tagline is based on. However, it may be several more months before Apple fully rolls out all of Siri's upgrades.

The iPhone 16 is built with aerospace-grade aluminum and is available in some new colors, including ultramarine, teal and pink to go with white and black. It’s built for greater durability too. Apple says it’s water- and dust-resistant, and has a new glass-ceramic screen that’s said to be 50 percent tougher than the one of the iPhone 15 and twice as strong as ""any other smartphone."" Much like the Apple Watch lineup, the screen can be as dark as 1 nit or as bright as 2,000 nits. The screen sizes remain the same at 6.1 inches for the iPhone 16 and 6.7 inches for the iPhone 16 Plus.

Apple claims there's a bigger battery in the iPhone 16 as well, which is always welcome to hear. The company claims it will work in concert with the A18 and the power efficiency features of iOS 18 to deliver longer battery life. Apple says the iPhone 16 will deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback, 18 hours of streaming video and 80 hours of audio playback on a single charge.

Emergency SOS live video (Apple)

On the safety front, you'll be able to share live videos if you need to use the Emergency SOS function. Messages via satellite and other messaging features are coming to the US and Canada, while Emergency SOS and Find My via satellite are available in 18 countries, including the US.

Elsewhere, Apple is bringing Wi-Fi 7 to the base models for the first time this year. That's a nice upgrade — as long as you have a compatible router, of course. That should help future-proof the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus to a degree as well.

Pre-orders for the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus open on Friday, and they will be available on September 20. Pricing starts at $799 for the iPhone 16 and $899 for the iPhone 16 Plus, each of which have 128GB of storage at the base level. They'll also be available with 256GB or 512GB of storage.

Apple has kicked off its biggest event of the year, where it unveils a myriad new devices. Although the 10th anniversary Apple Watch is the star among wearables being unveiled today, the Watch Ultra is getting some attention in the form of a new Satin Black finish without many internal changes. That means, there’s no actual update besides the new finish, but Apple has a lot to back it up.

The new Satin Black Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also made with Grade-5 recycled titanium. Apple says the finish has been achieved through a blasting process. To match the new finish, Apple is betting on a dark zirconia crystal for the underside. The orange accents remain unchanged from previous generations.

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 now comes with a matching new titanium Milanese Loop band with intricately woven metal parts. The buckle now has connectors on both sides, which Apple says has been inspired by parachutes. Alongside the new titanium band, the Apple Watch Ultra also gets a new Alpine, Trail, and Ocean Loop bands in a darker gray shades, which, we hope, can be paired to other Apple Watch models as well. Apple also includes a new fabric band in partnership with Hermes.

Apple

Through watchOS 11, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 models — new and old — get the ability to detect sleep apnea, a medical condition that results in small stoppages in breathing that not only disrupts sleep but also have a lasting negative effect on your overall energy levels. Earlier this year, Samsung also added sleep apnea detection to its line of Galaxy Watch models.

As part of watchOS 11, the Watch Ultra 2 also gets stackable live activities complication on the watch face, direct media playback through the speaker, personalized trainer, and the ability to track your Training Load.

The Apple Watch Ultra has been surprisingly successful, so much so that it even inspired Samsung to make a similar smartwatch for the outdoorsy. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 had little to differ from the first-gen Watch Ultra, and the models combined became the second-best selling Apple Watch model between September last year and June 2024, despite a ban that blocks out the blood-oxygen sensor. That also means Apple’s detection of sleep apnea may be less accurate than Samsung, which uses low blood oxygen as a metric to state of “hypopnea” or disrupted flow of oxygen.

The first-gen Apple Watch Ultra is still an excellent companion for the iPhone. So, Apple’s choice to skip the third-generation Watch Ultra is forgivable. It already offers the longest battery life, the brightest display, and the most durable design on any Apple Watch model.

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 in Satin Black will cost $799. It is up for preorder starting today and will be available starting September 20."

A decade after the company revealed its first model, the Apple Watch Series 10 has a bigger screen and thinner design than all its predecessors. The watch also appears brighter from wider viewing angles, and it includes a redesigned speaker. The Apple Watch Series 10, available for pre-order now, is the biggest design change since Series 4.

The new Apple Watch comes in 46mm and 42mm screen sizes (up from 45mm and 41mm, respectively). Apple says the display on the Series 10 wearable has 30 percent more area than the Series 6 model. The display is even slightly bigger than that of the Apple Watch Ultra (when measured by area, not the diagonal). Apple says the watch’s wide-angle OLED screen is 40 percent brighter at angles than its predecessor.

The screen’s resolutions are 416 x 496 (46mm) and 374 x 446 (42mm). The display updates once per second, and the ticking second hand even shows while the device is in passive ambient mode. Both the display and case have more rounded corners than previous Apple Watch models.

Apple Watch Series 10 (Apple)

The Apple Watch Series 10 is nearly 10 percent thinner than the Series 9 model. It’s also 10 percent lighter than last year’s watch (or 20 percent lighter if you opt for the new titanium model). The latter replaces stainless steel as the wearable’s premium casing option. Apple says the thinner and lighter design on the Series 10 watch makes it “more comfortable than ever.”

Powering the device is the new S10 SIP (System in Package) chip, which Apple claims will enhance performance and efficiency. The S10 helps give the Apple Watch Series 10 longer “all-day” battery life: an estimated 18 hours. The company claims its improved fast charging can juice it up from empty to an 80 percent charge in 30 minutes.

The watch’s speakers are 30 percent smaller, allegedly without sacrificing audio performance. And its speakers can play media (like music and podcasts) for the first time — handy if you forget your AirPods. It also includes enhanced voice isolation for clearer calls in loud environments.

The watch’s metal back integrates with the antenna, which Apple says will enhance cellular performance and water resistance (up to 50m). That new water resistance combines with its built-in depth gauge and water temperature sensor for diving capabilities. Supporting that on the software side is the Depth app (previously only available on the Ultra model) and the new Tides app, which offers seven-day tidal forecasts, sunrise and sunset times and local beach info for surfing, fishing and other underwater activities. There’s also an Oceanic+ app for the snorkelers out there.

The Apple Watch Series 10 includes sleep apnea tracking, another first in the lineup. The company says the wearable uses the accelerometer and machine learning to look for breathing disturbances when you wear it overnight. Apple expects FDA approval for that feature soon. You’ll find sleep apnea insights in a new Breathing Disturbances category in the Health app.

Apple describes the new wearable as a carbon-neutral product. The company says the Series 10 watch uses 95 percent recycled aluminum and is made with 100 percent renewable electricity.

Apple Watch Series 10 (Apple)

Of course, the new Apple Watch (along with older models starting with Series 6 and the second-gen SE) will run watchOS 11. The 2024 software adds the ability to pause and further customize Rings and Activity goals, along with a new Vitals app to check overnight metrics, training loads and pregnancy data.

The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399 for a GPS-only variant. (The titanium model starts at $699.) The GPS + cellular model costs $499. Pre-orders start today, and it will be available starting on September 20. The aluminum model is available in jet black (for the first time), rose gold and silver aluminum. The titanium model comes in natural, gold and slate. New band styles this year include collaborations with Nike and Hermès and an updated Milanese Loop.

September is here and, like clockwork, so are new iPhones. Apple unveiled its latest iPhone models at an event in Cupertino today, and as expected, the iPhone 16 handsets are largely iterative of last year's models. While the smartphones, standard and Pro versions, took center stage, Apple also showed off the new Apple Watch Series 10, two new pairs of AirPods and hearing aid features coming to the second-generation AirPods Pro. The company also went into detail on its latest mobile chipsets that power the new iPhones, and reminded folks what they can expect when iOS 18 launches later this month with Apple Intelligence. If you weren't able to catch the announcements live, Engadget has you covered; here's everything announced at Apple's iPhone 16 event.

iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus

iPhone 16 (Apple)

Apple unveiled the new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus at the event, which feature a water- and dust-resistant design and new colors including ultramarine, teal and pink. The iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch display. Both of those can achieve up to 2,000 nits of brightness, and can go all the way down to 1 nit in the dark. The Action button has found its way to this series of iPhones as well, and it's just as customizable as the one we saw on last year's Pro-model iPhones.

There's also a new easy-access camera control ""button"" of sorts, which allows you to quickly control the camera with a slide of your finger. This tool can also tap into Visual Intelligence, an AI-powered feature coming in iOS 18 that can tell you more about anything you point your camera at. It appears similar to Google Lens, and can do things like add live event dates to your calendar after you point your camera at a flyer you see on the street. The camera array on the standard iPhone 16 models includes a 48-megapixel main Fusion camera, a 12MP telephoto lens and a new ultrawide camera with autofocus. This array will also be able to capture Spatial Photos that can be viewed on Apple's Vision Pro.

Both standard iPhone 16 models run on the new A18 chip, which has a 16-core neural engine optimized for generative models. The internals feature a 6-core CPU and a 5-core GPU, both of which will be crucial for powering all of the new Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18.

According to Apple, both the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have larger batteries than their predecessors, and when combined with the efficiencies added from the A18 chipset and iOS 18 improvements, should make for a much longer-lasting battery lives overall (although Apple did not provide an exact estimate). Both the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are available for pre-order today starting at $799 and $899, respectively, and will be widely available on September 20.

iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max

iPhone 16 Pro (Apple)

The Pro series of iPhones includes the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max this year, which have 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch ProMotion, always-on displays, respectively. Both are made with Grade 5 Titanium, which Apple claims to be even lighter than stainless steel. These handsets will be available in four new colors: black, white, natural and desert, the latter of which resembles a dusty gold color.

According to the company, the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max are built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence, being able to take full advantage of all the new features coming in iOS 18. These handsets run on the new A18 Pro chipset, which takes advantage of 3nm transistors and is even faster and more efficient than the standard A18 chip found in the regular iPhone 16 lineup.

The rear camera array on both models includes a 48MP Fusion camera, 48MP ultrawide shooter and a 12MP telephoto lens. The main camera's improvements allow for 4K, 120fps video and slow-motion recording. Both phones also have the new camera control button that provides easier access to the camera and all of its tools, both for capture and editing. There are also four studio-quality microphones built in to both smartphones for improved audio capture, and they allow for Spatial Audio recording, too.

Both the iPhone 16 Pro series and the standard iPhone 16 handsets supports Qi2 wireless charging, and Apple will come out with new MagSafe charging cases that account for the new camera control button. The iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 13, starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively. They'll be widely available on September 20.

AirPods 4

AirPods 4 (Apple)

AirPods 4 launched today during the iPhone 16 event, as rumors suggested. These have a redesigned bud shape that's suppose to fit more ear shapes and be more comfortable overall. They have the H2 chip inside, which will provide improved audio quality and enable features like Personalized Spatial Audio. The charging case has a USB-C port, and it's the smallest AirPods charging case to date.

In addition to the regular AirPods 4, there will be a second model that includes support for active noise cancellation and Transparency mode. Conversation Awareness will also automatically lower your media volume level when the buds detect you talking to someone. The standard AirPods 4 cost $129 and the AirPods 4 with ANC cost $179; both are available for pre-order today and will be widely available on September 20.

AirPods Max new colors

Apple didn’t reinvent the wheel with the updated AirPods Max. Instead, they’ll be available in a few new colors (midnight, blue, purple, orange and starlight) and support USB-C charging. The new colors can be pre-ordered today for $549 and will be widely available on September 20.

AirPods Max $549 at Apple

AirPods Pro new hearing aid features

Apple announced new features coming to the second-gen AirPods Pro that are designed to help prevent (and increase awareness around) hearing loss. A feature called ""Hearing Protection"" will be turned on by default, and users will be able to take a clinically-validated hearing test to see if they already have some hearing loss. On top of that, AirPods Pro will have a clinical-grade hearing aid feature built-in as well, which will work with a hearing profile created after a user takes the hearing test.

Apple Watch Series 10

Apple Watch Series 10 (Apple)

Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 10 today, the natural successor to last year’s Series 9. It has the biggest display and thinnest design ever on an Apple Watch, and the wide-angle OLED display is even a bit larger than that on the Apple Watch Ultra. The case has more rounded corners and a wider aspect ratio, both of which, combined with the larger screen, should provide more space to interact with graphics and text on the Watch. Apple claims the screen is 40 percent brighter when looked at from an angle, and it'll show a second hand ticking away even when your wrist is down.

The Apple Watch Series 10 is powered by the new S10 SiP chip, which Apple claims is built for performance, power efficiency and intelligence (i.e. Apple Intelligence). One example of Apple Intelligence at work on the Series 10 is the new Photos watch face, which will curate the best photos from your library and serve them up to you automatically.

When it comes to fitness features, Apple announced that the latest version of watchOS will allow the Series 10 to detect signs of sleep apnea, provided you're wearing your Series 10 to sleep regularly. Apple claims it's awaiting FDA clearance, and it expects the sleep apnea detection feature to launch in more than 150 countries. Elsewhere in the activity sphere, the Series 10 will have scuba tracking features and it will support the new Tides app in watchOS 11.

Another new feature is the ability to play audio directly from the Watch's speaker, which could be helpful if you don't have AirPods or another pair of Bluetooth earbuds handy. The Apple Watch Series 10 be available in a new polished, jet-black aluminum finish and new polished titanium finishes. It's available for pre-order today and will be widely available on September 20.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 new finish

While there have been a bunch of swirling rumors about the next iteration of the Apple Watch Ultra, the company did not reveal the third generation sportswatch today. Instead, Apple revealed a new finish for the Apple Watch Ultra 2: satin black. There are also new Hermes finishes, and a new Milanese band to accompany the new satin black finish.

Like the addition of 5G before it, industry watchers believed that Apple Intelligence’s arrival might convince holdouts to bite the bullet and upgrade their device.

We’ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow’s “It’s Glowtime” event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it's believed that Apple Intelligence's slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential.

In June, Apple showed the world a take on AI firmly in-line with its mission statement of prioritizing user experience. Trained on small models -- instead of the massive black boxes behind services like Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT -- Apple’s play is centered around improving existing experiences through generative AI.

As Bloomberg notes today, however, delays could impact the iPhone 16's bottom line. WWDC offered a lot of big promises, but we’re unlikely to see many delivered until 2025. Regional limitations present key roadblocks as well, including in the EU and China -- the latter of which can make or break Apple financials in any given quarter. ChatGPT integration, meanwhile, is also unlikely for launch.

In the lead up to WWDC, the industry wondered whether Apple would be able to become a major player with the generative AI competition. But while the developer conference wowed observers with impressive demos, there’s still a lot of catching up to do.

At the time of writing, iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max are the only devices approved to run Apple Intelligence. Tomorrow’s event is set to change that, especially as further rumors point to increased uniformity across the iPhone 16 line. The base models are expected to get A18 chips, with the Pros, fittingly, getting an A18 Pros.

While sales are incredibly important to Apple and its shareholders, Apple Intelligence is a massive, multi-faceted undertaking, and rushing it out too early could have a longer term adverse impact on the company's bottom line than a staggered rollout."

Apple's big Glowtime launch event is just around the corner, where we expect to get our first official look at Apple's iPhone 16 series. Rumors have been swirling for months now, and the latest suggests Apple will adopt SoftBank-owned Arm's newest V9 chip design in its next-gen smartphones — the same architecture behind its upcoming line of M4 MacBook chips to support a suite of AI-powered features.

Apple plans to reveal the A18 chip based on Arm’s newest design architecture at Monday's event, according to sources familiar who spoke with the Financial Times. Arm’s architecture, which is used in nearly every smartphone chip, outlines how a central processor works at its most basic level.

Last September, Apple signed a deal with Arm through 2040 ""and beyond,"" securing access to a core piece of intellectual property, the Arm architecture, used in its iPhone and Mac chips, for the foreseeable future. The multi-year licensing agreement also represents a huge boost for Arm. Arm CEO Rene Haas previously said the V9 chip architecture, originally launched in 2021, brings in twice the royalties of its last-gen V8, which can be found in Apple's A17 Pro chip for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Another step forward for Apple Intelligence

This marks the latest step in Apple's push to bring generative AI features under the Apple Intelligence branding to its smartphones. A full Apple Intelligence release is expected sometime in 2025, but we know a lot about what to expect thanks to several features being out in the wild via developer betas for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1.

Similar to Microsoft Copilot in Windows, Apple Intelligence can automatically perform tasks within the operation system and works across devices (so long as they run on either an M-series chip or an A17 or above on iPhone). Some features worth shouting out include generating text or images, rewriting text to make it more engaging or legible, removing any distracting objects from a background or identifying users in photos, and upgrading Siri to understand and respond to more natural language.

But running on-device AI models takes a lot of computing power, and that means if Apple wants to bring Apple Intelligence on something that'll fit in your pocket like an iPhone, it'll need top-of-the-line, energy-efficient chip technology under the hood.

We'll have to wait until Apple's big showcase on Monday to learn more. In the meantime, be sure to check out our guide to how to watch the Apple Glowtime event.

Apple’s upcoming Glowtime event is just days away, and while plenty has already been revealed about the iPhone 16 Pro, it seems there’s still time for one or two new surprises to emerge. “Reliable sources” speaking to 9to5Mac have revealed some camera tricks the Pro-model handsets will ship with when it debuts on Monday.

The most exciting of these is the ability to shoot 4K video at 120 frames per second (FPS). While certain high-end Android phones have been able to do this for some time, it’s new to the iPhone, where even the iPhone 15 Pro Max tops out at 60FPS when taking 4K video. You’ll be able to up to this visually lossless ProRes 4K at 120FPS, but only if you’re connected to external storage.

The site reports it has also seen evidence that Apple has tested 8K video filming on the iPhone 16 Pro models, which seems plausible given the ultrawide lenses are reportedly being bumped to 48MP (confirmed again here by 9to5Mac’s sources), and the A18 Pro chip seems ready for the resolution too.

That said, the article says it’s currently “unclear” whether Apple will enable 8K recording on production devices, given the zoom lens would still be capped at 4K. Instead, it suggests, Apple may save 8K for the iPhone 17 family.

There are other improvements mooted, however. There will apparently be the ability to pause and resume video recordings in the camera app, the removal of wind noise from videos, new Photographic Styles with enhanced machine learning to preserve skin tones, Vision Pro compatible 3D Spatial Photos and support for the JPEG-XL format. While it’s not explicitly stated, it seems likely that at least some of these will be supported by the regular iPhone 16 too, given a few appear to be software rather than hardware-based tweaks.

The report also provides more insights into how the long-rumored Capture Button will work. The site’s sources say that it’s a touch-sensitive button that can perform different actions depending on whether you press or slide it.

Known internally as the “Camera Button” (though likely to be something more marketable on release), a simple press will open up the camera app or a third-party app of your choice. Once inside, a hard press will take a photo or start shooting video, while a soft press will trigger auto-focus. If you slide your finger across the button, the camera will adjust either zoom or exposure.

We don’t have long to wait to see what else the new handsets have in store, with Apple’s Glowtime event scheduled to kick off in just a few days, on Monday 9th September. While the iPhone 16 will undoubtedly be the star of the show, we’re also expecting to see the Apple Watch 10, AirPods 4 and perhaps even the iPad mini 7.

While we’ll cover all the news as it breaks, you can also tune in to see it unfold in real-time — here’s how to watch the Apple Glowtime event."

Apple has been slowly making more and more components of its devices in house; a new report claims that batteries could soon join the ranks of parts that Apple develops on its own. And those batteries could find their way into Apple products as soon as next year.

The Korean website ETNews (via MacRumors) reports from industry sources that Apple has been working on its own batteries since at least 2018 when the iPhone maker began hiring people with battery experience and applying for related patents.

Apple is looking to build a ""completely new"" battery with vastly improved performance, ETNews says, adding that Apple is in the process of putting together cathode materials to determine performance.

Apparently, the Apple battery has a totally different composition compared to other batteries currently available. It combines raw materials like nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminum for improved performance.

Reportedly, the company is also exploring silicon content as a cathode material, different from the graphite that has traditionally been used. However, ETNews notes that silicon has a problem with volume expansion during charging and discharging, and Apple is working to get around that issue.

Reports further claim that Apple is looking into carbon nanotubes to improve conductivity, as that would deliver better performance from less common materials. That switch also could lead to faster charging times.

The resulting battery is supposed to be an innovation that has not yet been commercialized. A source suggested to ETNews that the Apple Vision Pro headset significantly increased Apple's need for high-performance batteries. The $3,500 product is rated for just 2 to 2.5 hours of battery life. Meanwhile, devices like the Apple Watch have had the same ""all-day"" rating since they were introduced, while rival smartwatches now last multiple days on a charge.

Nothing in the ETNews report details where Apple is at in the construction of these batteries or what kind of performance improvements have been discovered in the exploration.

Most batteries are lithium-ion and composed of an anode, cathode and an electrolyte layer. The anode is generally made of lithium metals while the cathode is made from graphite. According to Reliance Digital, most smartphones pack a ""Li-ion"" battery because it can hold more power cells while maintaining a smaller footprint inside a device.

In general, across the industry, battery performance has seen significant performance improvements in recent years either through physical engineering like power efficiency of chipsets or software wrangling of the battery and operating systems.

And Apple isn't the only company working on improved batteries. Over the summer, OnePlus announced the ""glacier battery"" which allegedly crams a 6,100 mAh capacity battery cell into a 5,000 mAh slot. That battery is built on silicon carbon anode technology and allegedly provides two days of use on a single charge.

Other companies like Realme, have been pushing forward the ability of chargers. The company recently announced a 320W charger that is supposed to be capable of fulling charging a smartphone battery in less than 5 minutes. That charger is not yet available on any actual smartphones, though.

Allegedly, Apple's battery project was co-developed with Apple's go at an Apple Car that has since been cancelled. After that the focus shifted toward mobile applications. If reports are to be believed, we should start seeing the Apple battery in their products in 2025.

Thinking about upgrading to the iPhone 16? You certainly aren't alone, as we speed towards Apple's launch event on September 9 – but a new study has broken down why most of us are considering taking the plunge.

A new report from CIRP (Consumer Intelligence Research Partners) reveals the results of its survey, which asked respondents why they were upgrading to a new iPhone (in the year up to June 2024).

The number one reason, chosen by 44% of people, was simply because their current phone was 'obsolete'. For iOS 18, those phones include the iPhone 8 series and first-gen iPhone SE – so it's likely that a significant number of iPhone 16 buyers will be coming from those models, rather than more recent ones.

On a similar theme, the second most popular reason for upgrading (which covered 29% of respondents) was because their current phone was ""lost/broken/stolen"". In total, that means 73% of iPhone upgraders are doing so because they're effectively forced into it by their current situation, rather than for any new whizz-bang features.

A pie chart showing the reasons why people are upgrading their iPhones

Only 18% of people in the survey said they were upgrading their iPhone to get ""new features"", which is a surprisingly small number. In the iPhone 16's case, those new tricks are expected to be new Apple Intelligence-powered AI tools, including Clean Up for photos, along with a new A17 Pro (or A18 Pro) chip, an Action button on all models, and battery upgrades.

It's possible that, after release, the iPhone 16's specific improvements could change that picture for upgraders and increase the proportion of those switching for new features, but looking at the rumors so far we'd say that's unlikely – with these survey results reflecting the issue that most of us are holding onto our phones for longer, due to a mix of plateauing innovation and longer software support.

The iPhone conundrum

An iPhone on a green background showing a WhatsApp survey result

The days of enormous hardware leaps between iPhone models – most notably, in the realm of cameras – have been over for some time, and this survey reflects that reality. Around three quarters of us get a new iPhone simply because we have problems with our old phone, whether that's running iOS or Android.

That said, it is likely that the number of people upgrading to the iPhone 16 for its new features will be higher than the 16% in this survey, given it covered all iPhone models. And as we've previously argued, the iPhone is still probably the only phone that's actually worth upgrading to every year, if you're that way inclined.

One of the reasons for this is because iPhones tend to hold their value better than Android phones, which makes regular trade-ins more appealing (and upgrading less expensive). The other, less complementary, factor is that Apple tends to be slower in rolling out new features to iPhones compared to Android, so there's often more value in each upgrade.

Our recent WhatsApp survey (above) gave us a taste of some of the more specific reasons why many are considering upgrading to the iPhone 16. The winner was the promise of better battery life, followed by the unique AI features promised by Apple Intelligence – so those features do still hold some appeal, even if it isn't clear when many (including the revamped Siri) will fully roll out.

A significant number of iPhone 16 buyers will also likely come from Android, according to recent data – in June 2024, for example, 17% of iPhone buyers in the US came from Android, which was the highest switching rate for several years. Let's hope the big Apple event delivers and gives us enough reasons to hit up the iPhone 16 preorders, which are expected to start on September 13.

Apple is set to announce the new iPhone 16 line-up on 9 September in a move that will signal the tech giant’s first serious foray into the world of artificial intelligence (AI), spearheaded by a new version of Siri.

The live event in Cupertino, California will be livestreamed on Apple’s site as well as on YouTube, and is expected to debut 'Apple Intelligence' - Apple’s response to rivals such as Samsung and Google which have already baked in AI features into their flagship smartphones this year.

Apple is also expected to unveil new watches and Airpods as well as the usual hardware upgrades across its iPhone and Pro line. The event is billed as ‘Glowtime’, which insiders suggest refers to the boosted on-screen glow of Apple’s Siri assistant, which will receive an AI upgrade this year.

When is Apple's iPhone 16 launch event?

The Glowtime event will take place in the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Monday 9 September.

The event starts at 10am Pacific Time in the US, or 6pm UK time, and will probably last between one and two hours – judging by previous Apple events – with the biggest news generally held for the end.

What will the iPhone 16 look like?

The latest models will replace the iPhone 15, pictured, but are set to look similar. (PA)

There will be four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max – which will look similar to last year’s iPhone 15 line-up.

The two smaller phones are expected to add Apple’s Action button, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, while the new Pro models will add a camera button with touch controls (swipe to zoom, touch lightly to autofocus).

The Pro models are also expected to have very slightly bigger screens, with the Pro at 6.3in (up from 6.1in) while the Pro Max will be 6.9in (up from 6.7in).

Which new features will it have?

Siri is expected to have a total revamp in the latest iPhones. (Getty)

The biggest news is a total revamp of Siri, which will be integrated more tightly into the operating system - and have a new ‘glowing’ look.

When users summon Siri, instead of a glowing ball at the bottom, the edges of the display glow instead - hence ‘Glowtime’.

The new phones are expected to have a large number of AI features under the banner Apple Intelligence, billed as ""AI for the rest of us"".

Apple wrote earlier this year: ""With an all-new design, richer language understanding, and the ability to type to Siri whenever it’s convenient for you, communicating with Siri is more natural than ever.

Mobile phone with website of AI platform Apple Intelligence in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display.

""Equipped with awareness of your personal context, the ability to take action in and across apps, and product knowledge about your devices’ features and settings, Siri will be able to assist you like never before.

Apple Intelligence is expected to offer new writing tools including the ability to summarise long content such as websites and lectures, alongside image creation tools including AI Genmoji.

Apple aims to protect users' privacy, with much of the processing done ‘on device’, so private details are never compromised.

When will the iPhone 16 be released?

Tech publications including Forbes and Bloomberg have predicted that (judging by past events) the new iPhones will go on sale on the Friday of the week following the announcement.

This year, that would mean the new iPhones would go on sale on 20 September.

How much will the iPhone 16 cost?

Some leaks have suggested that some iPhone 16 models will retain the prices of last year’s models.

With the new phones seen as an incremental hardware upgrade, before bigger changes arrive next year, it’s plausible that they will keep the same price."

The aptly named Snapdragon X Plus 8-core trims down the core count that we’ve seen on a wave of Snapdragon X Elite laptops to undercut the competition from Apple. Qualcomm says that machines sporting the new CPU, which could show up on the list of the best laptops, will be available to purchase starting today.

The Snapdragon X Plus isn’t new, but this is a new variant of the chip. The major difference is right in the name. This CPU comes with eight cores instead of 10, but Qualcomm is still using a 4nm process, and it says the chip can reach up to 3.4GHz with single-core boosts up to 4GHz. Critically, the chip still sports a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), allowing it to show up in Copilot+ laptops with 45 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) of power. Laptops sporting this chip should come with great battery life as well — that’s a common thread we’ve seen with Qualcomm laptops like the new Dell XPS 13 9345.

Qualcomm

Although this new chip will likely be weaker than the 10-core Snapdragon X Plus and 12-core Snapdragon X Elite, Qualcomm says it’s still much more powerful than the competition. The company says the chip delivers 108% better performance than the Intel Core Ultra 5 125U at 15 watts in multi-core performance, and that it provides a single-core advantage of 40% at 6W compared to the AMD Ryzen 5 8640U. Qualcomm likes to use these efficiency metrics, showing what it can deliver at certain power levels. As we’ve seen with new x86 laptops like the Asus Zenbook S 16, peak performance numbers are much closer than Qualcomm suggests.

Qualcomm

Performance isn’t the main draw here, however. Price is. Qualcomm says this new CPU “enables” Copilot+ laptops in the $700 to $900 range. The verbiage here is important because it doesn’t appear Qualcomm is saying that these new laptops will be between $700 and $900 — the company is just saying that price range is possible. Two of the first laptops sporting this chip that we know about, the Asus Vivobook S 15 and ProArt PZ13, are arriving at $899 and $1,099, respectively.

Even if only a handful of laptops can reach down to $700, though, that provides Qualcomm a big advantage compared to the competition from Apple. You’ll spend at least $1,000 on the MacBook Air, and that’s with the aging M2 chip. By offering Copilot+ laptops below that price, particularly with requirements like 16GB of RAM, Qualcomm could make a big dent in the mainstream market.

Qualcomm says that laptops with the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core will be available from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, with “select devices” available to purchase now."

Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 “It’s Glowtime” event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays.

The livestream kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most.

Apple Intelligence and Siri

Back at WWDC in June, Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name — Apple Intelligence — which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The “small model” method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it’s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience.

That’s a marked difference between it and much larger “black box” models like OpenAI's and Google's Gemini. The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence’s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as — at the very least — all of generative AI is, at the end of the day.

The answer for how this all ties into “Glowtime” can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced a much-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant. Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing.

Out of every iPhone ever launched, two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence: the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that’s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro’s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter.

With all of this in mind, next week’s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line.

iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max

We’re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what’s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you’re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out.

That will reportedly bump the Pro Max’s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device’s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches.

Camera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunch is a new glass molded lens that is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don’t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart.

https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1775704247348412559?s=20

Leaked dummy models from early in the year give us a rough idea of each model’s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new “Capture” button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities.

The most welcome change, however, may be bigger batteries. Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additional reports, meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks.

The Pro models are also expected to gain Wi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard.

Apple Watch Series 10/Ultra 3

five color options for Apple watch series 9

As hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it'd have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor — something especially important when discussing a watch.

Like the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor — the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn’t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but as Bloomberg notes, Apple’s legal woes with Masimo may well trip up that feature.

A long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week.

AirPods 4

Stay with me on this one. Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its products to comply with EU mandates.

So, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We’ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we’re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however, finally get the over-ear AirPods Max 2, four years after the original.

New Macs

This one is a big maybe. Recent reporting suggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac’s release calendar ever since the pandemic. A big, USB-A-less version of the Mac Mini is said to be arriving before end of year, along with a new iMac and MacBook Pro.

Apple's 'Glowtime' event is now less than a week away and the stage is set for the unveiling of the company's iPhone 16 series of smartphones coinciding with the full release of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia — with each platform redesigned and upgraded with AI in mind to play host to Apple Intelligence later in the year.

The internet is abuzz with iPhone 16 rumors, with leaks hinting towards a redesigned camera island, an improved OLED display, and a powerful new A18 Bionic chipset capable of running on-device AI tools and features.

Meanwhile, quietly in the background, two of Apple's long-rumored and much-anticipated products sit in the wings, waiting for their moment in the spotlight: the iPhone SE 4 and iPad mini 7.

However, that wait may be over. According to one report, stock of the current iPhone SE 3 and iPad mini 6 are in short supply — a trademark tell-tale sign from Apple that new models are on the way, and a potential heads up to a surprise unveiling at this month's special 'It's Glowtime' event.

iPhone SE 4: What it is and what to expect

A new iPhone SE has reportedly been in the works for some time and has been the subject of many leaks and rumors in 2024. From a radical shift in design to utterings of it being Apple's most accessible way of engaging with its new AI suite, Apple Intelligence, the fourth-generation iPhone SE is supposedly decked-out to take the budget smartphone market by storm.

It was 2022 when Apple released the last iPhone SE, and since then we've seen Google's Pixel A-series smartphones dominate when it comes to affordable, feature-rich handsets. However, Apple appears set to make a strong return to this category, with the new iPhone SE 4 rumored to feature a 6.1-inch, 60Hz, OLED panel, 12W wireless charging, Face ID, and one of Apple's later A-series Bionic chipsets — all of which will hopefully be bundled with a price tag south of $500 to remain competitive with the iPhone 16's expected $699 starting price.

The iPhone SE 4 is also expected to adopt a similar design to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 while including the iPhone 15 Pro's Action Button. This new design is a departure from its predecessor's iPhone 8-inspired look, ditching the physical home button for a more full-screen look and familiar aluminum frame, though maintaining its simple single-lens rear camera layout.

iPad mini 7: What it is and what to expect

It feels like the iPad mini 7 has been rumored to make an appearance at almost every Apple event the company has hosted this year. Perhaps most obviously, the iPad mini 7 was widely rumored to feature alongside the new iPad Pro M4 and iPad Air 6 M2 at Apple's ""Let Loose"" event in May. However, beyond a passing mention, we've yet to hear anything of note from Apple when it comes to its pocketable iPad.

That said, its existence and impending release are heralded by reliable sources such as analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, but there appears to be no clear consensus between sources on exactly when we'll see Apple officially unveil the iPad mini 7. It is reasonably well agreed upon that the mini may feature a later A-series Bionic chipset instead of one of Apple's M-series chips, increased storage options, and an improved display to fix the previous model's issues with ""jelly scrolling.""

When the iPad Mini 7 eventually makes an appearance, we won't be expecting a major overhaul beyond processor and display upgrades, and without the tablet featuring an M-series chipset, it's unlikely to support fresh accessories like the Apple Pencil Pro.

Finally time for a glow up?

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, both the current iPhone SE and iPad mini are facing stock shortages. However, far from this being a sudden run on these products, it's likely a sign of scaled-back production to prepare for new models to take their places.

We see similar drops in stock whenever Apple is preparing to launch a new product, and it's typically something spotted right before that product is unveiled. Also in short supply are models of Apple Watch and AirPods — both of which are rumored to have new models launching alongside the iPhone 16 during this month's ""It's Glowtime"" event.

Logically, this may imply that the iPhone SE 4 and iPad mini 7 could also feature at this month's event. However, a release at this time would fly in the face of at least one of these product's previous release windows.

Historically, the iPhone SE launches during spring, with the last three models being released between March and April.

Ever since Apple halted its annual upgrade cycle for the iPad mini, its release window has been a little harder to track. However, of the last three releases, two fell within September.

Given what we know about Apple's release habits, it's not beyond the realm of possibility to imagine the iPad mini 7 finally getting its moment to shine at this month's event.

As for the iPhone SE, Apple will likely stick to its spring launch window. However, that's not to say that this is definite. Should this year's iPhone lineup receive a bump in price, the release of the iPhone SE 4 within the same window could help Apple continue to ship units in the face of a global smartphone slump in sales.

That said, many insiders and analysts still point to a 2025 release for the iPhone SE. And despite continued confusion over the eventual availability of the iPad mini 7, the names attached to these claims are more often right than wrong.

The top iPhone shows the smartphone's display and iOS 17, the bottom phone is face down and shows the back panel and camera array.

Outlook

Ultimately, we won't know for certain what Apple's plans are until they announce them during this month's ""It's Glowtime"" event. However, certain indicators suggest a relatively stacked card and a mixed bag of featured products.

Given the routinely predicted release of a small-scale iPad this year from usually reliable sources, the iPad mini 7 feels long overdue. A low-cost option for both iPad and iPhone feels like a safe bet for Apple to bank on if they plan on boosting sales ahead of the Holiday season and October's expected launch of new Macs.

Seeing both products finally make it to store shelves would be a massive boon for Apple fans, but if we had to pick one of these products as the most likely to feature during this month's event, it would be the iPad mini 7.

Still, with Apple, there's always room for a surprise or two.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. No, not the holiday season, but unofficial smartwatch launch season.

We’ve already seen shiny new devices debut from the likes of Samsung, Google and Garmin. Now, it’s time to get ready for the granddaddy of all smartwatch launch shows at this year's Apple Event on September 9th.

Apple will likely show off its latest line of watches, including (presumably) the all-new Apple Watch 10. The original model was announced in ten years ago in September 2014. And ever since its debut, Apple has continuously pumped out many of the best smartwatches money can buy, while generally leading the pack when it comes to new features and tech.

By comparison, the first Google Pixel Watch didn’t arrive until 2022, eight years after the first Apple Watch, while the modern Galaxy Watch line launched in 2018. Of course, Samsung has been producing wearables going back to 2013’s Galaxy Gear. But, unlike the first Apple Watch, the Galaxy Gear was mostly a flop.

Apple Watch X render with larger display

In 2024, Samsung and Google have seriously upped the ante, and the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Google Pixel Watch 3 are nothing short of impressive; I’ve reviewed the former and am in the process of assessing the latter.

Needless to say, Apple has its work cut out. To remain the smartwatch king, here are five ways that the Cupertino giant can outshine the competition with the launch of the Apple Watch 10.

1. Offer more than 2 sizes

Samsung has long offered the Galaxy Watch range in multiple sizes, with the last several iterations available in 40mm or 44mm. Google, meanwhile, just introduced a second larger smartwatch model this year with the release of the Pixel Watch 3 in 41mm and 45mm.

Like Google, the Apple Watch 9 is available in either 41mm or 45mm and all signs point to similar size options for the Apple Watch 10. However, Apple could shake things up by offering the new wearable in a third size.

Fears of cannibalizing the Ultra line aside, a 49mm Apple Watch 10 could be a winner amongst fans of big screens. On the other hand, a smaller, 38mm option might appeal to those with smaller wrists or more fashion-conscious smartwatch shoppers.

2. Crush the 24-hour battery life mark

Under standard operating conditions, the Pixel Watch 3 and Galaxy Watch 7 offer roughly the same battery life as their predecessors: about 24 hours. Sure, you can stretch that to 36 hours or more when using either watch’s power-saving mode but battery life limitations remain a stumbling block for most full-feature smartwatches.

The Apple Watch 9 promises 18 hours of battery life (36 in power-saving mode) which isn’t particularly impressive. To match its rivals, hitting the 24-hour mark is a must. However, it’d be even more remarkable if Apple managed to double the battery life of its most popular wearable to 36 hours, matching that of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 ; this would be the ultimate dunk on Google and Samsung.

3. 100 meters of water resistance

Aside from high-end rugged models like the Apple Watch Ultra range, most smartwatches offer no more than 50 meters of water resistance. This may sound like a lot but in reality, it means that your watch can survive brief periods of surface-level swimming, often thirty minutes or less, without damage.

So, while your new Galaxy Watch 7 and Pixel Watch 3 are fine for some splashing around, they’re not suitable for activities like snorkeling, diving or waterskiing. Surfing and river rafting are also probably out.

The Apple Watch 9 is also stuck at 50 meters of water resistance but there’s no reason that the Apple Watch 10 has to be. Bumping the rating up to 100 meters would mean folks could truly wear it in water without worry for all but the most extreme scuba diving scenarios.

4. Increase screen brightness beyond 2,000 nits

Brighter screens are better and Apple has long led the way when it comes to maximum screen output. Both the Pixel Watch 3 and Galaxy Watch 7 max out a respectable 2,000 nits which is more than bright enough for viewing in bright sunlight.

While the older Galaxy Watch 6 also sports a 2,000-nit display, an increase in max screen brightness from 1,000 nits to 2,000 nits is one of the key selling points of the Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch 2 .

If Apple wants to really rain on Google’s parade, pushing the Apple Watch 10’s maximum brightness to 3,000 nits would surely do the trick. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 currently maxes out at 3,000 nits and the Ultra 3 could push things even further. If that happens, I see no reason why the Apple Watch 10 couldn’t conceivably receive a brightness boost, too.

5. Make it thinner

The Pixel Watch 3 remains the same thickness as its predecessor (12.3mm) regardless of whether you choose the 41mm or 45mm option. The Galaxy Watch 7, meanwhile, is 9.7mm thick in both 40mm and 44mm, or 0.7mm thicker than its predecessor.

The Apple Watch 9, by comparison, is 10.7mm thick, the same as the Apple Watch 8. None of these devices are particularly chunky and they all wear fairly comfortably on the wrist but a thinner smartwatch would still be welcomed.

Apple already needs to shave off 1mm of depth to match the Galaxy Watch 7 but I’d like to see an even greater reduction of 2mm. This would make the Apple Watch 10 the thinnest full-feature smartwatch on the market (that I’m aware of), giving Apple even more bragging rights over Google and Samsung.

The new Mac mini is also expected to have an internal power supply. Gurman reports that the standard and Pro versions will begin shipping to warehouses in September and October, respectively.

Apple is also reportedly working on a cheaper, pared down version of its Magic Keyboard that’s slated to launch “by the middle of next year.” The company introduced a new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro this spring, and Gurman indicates it’s now turning its attention to the non-Pro devices. He writes that the upcoming accessory “will be a low-end version that may be designed for an entry-level iPad or the new iPad Airs.”"

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to drop soon. Here are all the leaks and rumors we're seeing.

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is on the horizon. Apple officially announced that its next big event is on Sept. 9. Of course, we're expecting the new iPhone 16 series, but what typically comes alongside Apple's next-gen smartphones are new Apple Watch models.

In addition to the Apple Watch Series 10, we're on the lookout for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. As the big event nears, we're already seeing some rumors about the next-gen Apple Watch Ultra. Here are all the credible leaks you need to know about.

Apple Watch Ultra 3: Every single rumor we know

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will likely be the most premium Apple Watch model you can get. The Ultra variant is known for delivering better battery life, a brighter screen, and more options for high-performance athletes. It's larger, too.

But the question is, how does the Ultra 3, according to rumors, differ from the Ultra 2? Let's dig into the leaks, but first, let's discuss the release date.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 release date

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to get unveiled during the Sept. 9 ""Glowtime"" event.

Based on this reveal date, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will likely hit store shelves on Sept. 20.

I've been keeping an eye on the rumor mill, and as it stands now, there haven't been any credible details that have leaked regarding the Apple Watch Ultra 3's price.

The current Apple Watch Ultra, the second-generation model, has a starting price of $799. We're predicting the same price tag for the Apple Watch Ultra 3.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 design

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reliable Apple leaker and respected analyst, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will not get any significant hardware upgrades. As such, it's likely Apple will rely on a host of new software upgrades to make the Apple Watch Ultra 3 more appealing.

The Apple Watch Ultra is relatively nascent (it launched in 2022), so the Cupertino-based tech giant likely isn't ready to give it a major design overhaul just yet. For now, Gurman says the main hardware upgrade that the third-generation Apple Watch is getting is a new chip.

This is a departure from what we're hearing about the Apple Watch Series 10 models, which are reportedly getting bigger screens, according to Gurman.

As such, expect the Apple Watch Ultra 3 to maintain the same specs, more or less, as its predecessor:

49mm case size

Titanium chassis

Always-on display with up to 3,000 nits of brightness

Interestingly, rumor has it that Apple planned on releasing an Apple Watch Ultra model with a microLED display that would set consumers back $1,500. However, this has reportedly been delayed to 2027.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 health features and sensors

Apple has reportedly been working on adding three new health features to the Apple Watch:

Blood-pressure monitor Sleep apnea sensor Glucose monitor

However, there has been scuttlebutt that Apple has been running into issues with the blood-pressure monitor in particular, especially for the Watch Series 10 design. And independent of the watches, the blood pressure sensor has been too unreliable during testing, according to Gurman.

It's unclear whether Apple will skip the blood pressure feature for the Apple Watch Series 10 and add it to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 — or ditch it altogether.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 battery life

If the rumor about Apple delaying the microLED display until 2027 is true, then the Apple Watch Ultra 3 may not get the battery life boost many were crossing their fingers for.

As it stands now, Apple claims that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers up to 36 hours of battery life. If the specs remain unchanged, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 may have the same runtime.

Apple Watch Ultra 3: Will it be worth the upgrade?

""If you spent $799 on an Apple Watch Ultra last year, it's unlikely you'll want to spring for this version,"" Gurman said.

In conclusion, based on the rumors and leaks, it looks like the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will just be an iterative update.

The rumor mill says there won't be any major hardware upgrades, but hey, you never know what the Cupertino-based tech giant may have up its sleeves when it announces the Apple Watch Ultra 3 on Sept. 9.

It’s official: Apple’s annual September launch event is set for Monday, September 9. The tech giant confirmed the date via email invitations bearing the tagline ""It's Glowtime” (we’ve got ours), which suggests Apple Intelligence will take center stage at the Cupertino-set showcase next month.

But what else do we expect to see unveiled at this year’s Apple event? The iPhone 16 series is a shoo-in, while updates to Apple’s AirPods and Watch lines look likely, too. We’re also anticipating a host of announcements related to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, watchOS 11, macOS Sequoia, and tvOS 18.

Below, we’ve detailed five things we expect to see announced at the upcoming Apple event, as well as three things we almost definitely won’t see.

What to expect

iPhone 16 series

iPhone 15 on an orange background

Apple’s September events almost always play host to the launch of a new iPhone line, and we’re expecting as much from this year’s showcase. Four iPhone 16 models are slated for release next month – specifically the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – with minor (rather than game-changing) upgrades tipped for all.

The standard iPhone 16 models are rumored to inherit the Action button from the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, while a so-called ‘Capture’ button will reportedly come to every model in the lineup. Expect the usual cocktail of Apple chipset upgrades, too, as well as new iPhone 16 colors.

Apple Intelligence

WWDC

As mentioned, the headline announcement of Apple’s September event will almost certainly be Apple Intelligence. The upcoming suite of AI-powered features was revealed at WWDC 2024 back in June, but we’re expecting to see it showcased on the iPhone 16 series and other compatible devices next month.

You'll find a full list of confirmed Apple Intelligence features in our dedicated Apple Intelligence hub, but so far we know that the toolset will include a smarter Siri, text summarization, writing assistance, and generative image creation. Incidentally, Apple’s ""It's Glowtime” tagline is likely a reference to the new ‘glow’ animation that'll appear when using Siri on Apple Intelligence-compatible iPhones.

Annoyingly, we’ve heard that Apple Intelligence could be delayed until after the initial rollout of iOS 18, with Apple reportedly keen to fine-tune its AI features before making them available to the world. But even if that’s the case, we’ll surely be given a concrete release date for Apple Intelligence at next month’s Apple event.

iOS 18 and other software updates

iOS 18

Apple Intelligence will form part of iOS 18, but there are plenty of AI-free upgrades to get excited about in Apple’s next major (and sure-to-be-released-in-September) software update, which should please existing iPhone owners.

We know, for instance, that significant upgrades are coming to core iPhone apps including Messages, Mail, Photos, Maps, and Wallet, and that any iPhone newer than the iPhone XS will be compatible with iOS 18 (in other words, any iPhone with the A12 Bionic chipset or newer). For a more detailed rundown of the incoming features, check out our roundup of the five of the best iOS 18 features that'll work with your older iPhone.

We’re also expecting Apple’s September event to play host to iPadOS 18, watchOS 11, macOS Sequoia, and tvOS 18-related announcements.

New Apple Watches

Apple Watch Series 9 with Snoopy

Alongside the iPhone 16 series, we could see new Apple Watches announced next month. The Apple Watch 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 seem the most likely candidates, with the former model tipped to come in two sizes (1.89 inches and 2.04 inches).

Other rumored Apple Watch upgrades include new processors for both models and a larger display for the Watch 10. Interestingly, a plastic Apple Watch SE has also been tipped, which could offer prospective Apple Watch buyers a cheaper route into the watchOS ecosystem.

New AirPods

Lastly, there’s a high chance that new AirPods could drop next month. We’re not talking about the AirPods Pro 3, since Apple’s Pro-level earbuds have so far adhered to a three-year release cycle, and we've seen nothing concrete on the hotly anticipated AirPods Max 2's arrival, either. No, rumors instead suggest the imminent reveal of new entry-level and mid-range AirPods models.

As for what upgrades these new AirPods will bring, it’s safe to expect a more comfortable design and smarter listening modes, while Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has also noted that noise cancellation powers could come to the mid-range model.

What not to expect

iPhone Air

A render of a rumored iPhone Air model.

The iPhone 16 rumor mill has been rife with talk around a potential iPhone Slim, or iPhone Air, but this super-thin iPhone model will now reportedly arrive in 2025.

Bloomberg’s ever-reliable Apple tipster Mark Gurman notes that this reportedly in-development iPhone will have a much thinner chassis than any existing iPhone, while retaining most of the base-level iPhone 17’s core specs.

In terms of price, the iPhone Air looks set to sit somewhere between the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro (akin to how the original MacBook Air was positioned between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro), so those disappointed by the iPhone 16 line may have an entirely new iPhone model to look forward to next year, at least.

New iPads

iPad Pro 2024

New iPads will almost certainly be another no-show at this year’s September Apple event. Apple already debuted the long-awaited iPad Air 6 and iPad Pro (2024) at its May 7 Apple event, and we haven’t heard all that much about a successor to the iPad 10.9 (2022), so its reveal alongside the iPhone 16 line seems unlikely.

We could, however, potentially see the iPad mini 7 unveiled next month – as of August 2024, Apple has allowed iPad mini stock to run low, which is usually a sign that a new model is on the way – but Apple has also been known to quietly reveal new iPads via a press release, so we’re not all that confident about seeing a successor to the iPad mini (2021) in Cupertino. Here’s hoping we’re wrong, though.

New MacBooks

The new MacBook Pro with M3 chip in the new Space Black colorway.

M4-equipped MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac models are reportedly on track for a 2024 release, but they’re likely to come in October rather than September.

Reliable leaker Ross Young and Bloomberg tipster Mark Gurman believe that the MacBook Pro 2024 et al. are set to arrive ‘later’ this year, and an October launch would align with the release dates we saw for Apple’s most recent MacBook models in 2023.

Of course, Apple may be bold and announce the whole shebang in September – iPhones, iPads, MacBooks; the lot – but we’re quietly confident that the upcoming showcase will be dedicated to those aforementioned hardware and software launches.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the recall a more urgent classification Friday after making its original announcement Aug. 15. The new classification said the affected product may temporarily cause adverse health consequences but is unlikely to cause serious or irreversible medical issues.

The recall applies to 9,535 cases of Great Value brand apple juice sold in 25 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Florida-based manufacturer Refresco Beverages US Inc. voluntarily recalled the contaminated six-packs of 8-ounce (227-gram) juice bottles after discovering levels of the chemical contaminant that exceeded industry standards.

A spokesperson for Refresco did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Sunday.

“The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,” Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman said in a statement. “We have removed this product from our impacted stores and are working with the supplier to investigate.”

Very low levels of inorganic and organic arsenic are found in many food products, according to the National Institutes of Health. Testing is routine, as slightly elevated levels of either form can cause symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness and muscle cramping.

Inorganic arsenic is more toxic to humans than the naturally occurring form of the mineral arsenic, and the health effects from exposure are more severe, according to the FDA. The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled inorganic arsenic a carcinogen, or a substance that causes cancer.

Levels found in the recalled apple juice bottles are low enough that the FDA does not expect them to cause such severe health consequences.

The FDA has not shared reports of possible illnesses associated with the apple juice recall.

A California woman whose mail was recently stolen used technology as bait to track down the thieves, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office says.

Authorities in Los Alamos arrested two suspects on Monday with the help of an Apple AirTag locator device the woman had mailed to herself, the sheriff’s office said in a news release.

Deputies responded that morning to a report of a mail theft that had just happened at the local post office. When they arrived, they learned the woman recently had mail stolen, so she decided to send herself a package with the tracking device inside, according to the release.

She became a repeat mail theft victim on Monday – but this time, she was able to track the thieves thanks to the AirTag, authorities said.

The devices work by sending out a Bluetooth signal that nearby devices in Apple’s Find My network can detect, according to Apple. The AirTag sends its location to a user’s iCloud, allowing them to see where it is on the Find My map.

“It is important to note that the victim did not attempt to contact the suspects on her own,” the sheriff’s office said in the release.

The suspected thieves were located in nearby Santa Maria, California, with the victim’s mail – including the package containing the AirTag – and other items authorities believe were stolen from more than a dozen victims, according to the sheriff’s office.

Virginia Franchessca Lara, 27, and Donald Ashton Terry, 37, were arrested in connection with the crime, authorities said.

Lara was booked on felonies including possession of checks with intent to commit fraud, fictitious checks, identity theft, credit card theft and conspiracy, and remains held on a $50,000 bail as of Thursday, jail records show.

Terry faces felony charges including burglary, possession of checks with intent to commit fraud, credit card theft, identity theft and conspiracy and was held on a $460,000 bail, according to jail records.

CNN has reached out to lawyers representing Lara and Terry for comment.

In the release, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office also commended the AirTag’s owner “for her proactive solution” to track down the thieves.

Authorities said they’re working on contacting other victims of theft in this case.

The company typically does it on a Tuesday during the first half of the month, so September 10 is a safe bet. No matter when it happens, we'll be live-blogging the news, and you can watch it live via the company’s website or on YouTube. The biggest news from the event will almost definitely involve the forthcoming lineup of iPhone 16 handsets. Past as prologue, we’ll also get a new Apple Watch or two.

Beyond that, rumors have been swirling about a refresh of the standard AirPod earbuds. Until Tim Cook takes the (virtual) stage, however, everything is pure speculation. With that said, let’s get into the most likely leaks and rumors ahead of the event.

iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro

No matter what else happens, these new handsets will take center stage during the Apple iPhone 16 event. That’s good news for people ready for an upgrade. The bad (ish) news? The vast majority of leaks and rumors indicate that this will be another year of iterative improvements, so don’t expect a game-changing new hardware feature.

There’s likely to be four new models announced at the event, which is similar to what Apple did last year. The new phones will allegedly be called the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, according to industry analyst Mark Gurman. This is the exact same naming convention as last year’s iPhone 15 reveal, so the rumors of Apple adopting an “iPhone Ultra” moniker seem to have been greatly exaggerated.

Even if Apple doesn't use the Ultra naming, the Pro models might be getting slightly larger screens, which is always nice (if you like big phones, that is). The regular Pro is likely to move to 6.3 inches from 6.1 inches, while the Pro Max should hit 6.9 inches, an increase from 6.7 inches. Finally, there will likely be a new color or two, as always. Bloomberg’s Gurman suggests that Apple is ready to ditch the blue model in favor of the return of rose gold.

On the hardware side of things, look for a new chipset that takes advantage of the company’s recent push toward AI, also known as Apple Intelligence. Beyond that, the upgraded A18 chip will be an iterative improvement, specs-wise. As is typical, the Pro and Pro Max will likely get a more powerful chip than the standard models. It looks like the base amount of RAM here will be 8GB, so as to handle those aforementioned AI tasks.

It’s also been rumored that the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will get the Action Button, a feature introduced last year for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. This multi-purpose button is a direct replacement for the mute switch, by default, but can be adjusted to control a bunch of different things. The Action Button can be used to to change ringer settings, turn on the flashlight, launch the camera and more.

There’s also talk of another new button, this one on the right side of the phone. This will control camera features, operating like a button on a DSLR. Reporting indicates that a soft press will trigger autofocus and a harder press will take a photo. Consumers may also be able to swipe along the button to zoom in and out while shooting photos or taking videos. It’s been reported that this camera button will only come with the Pro and Pro Max, which makes sense since the high-end models typically offer a more robust camera experience.

To that end, new iPhones always get a camera spec bump, but we don’t know exactly what that will look like this time. It’s been reported, however, that the iPhone 16’s camera module could be getting a design refresh. Apple might be ditching the square and going with a vertical orientation. This might only apply to the base iPhone 16 and maybe the Plus, as the Pro and Pro Max phones tend to place a much higher emphasis on photos and videos.

The new operating system. (Apple)

We already know what’s coming on the software side of things, thanks to the recent WWDC event. Based on previous years, iOS 18 should be available within the week following the event. The software update features a more customizable Control Center and Home Screen. It'll also finally bring RCS support to iPhones.

As for Apple Intelligence, you’ll have to wait a bit. It was announced as part of iOS 18, but it’s been delayed until iOS 18.1. This isn’t a huge deal, as that OS refresh is expected in October, but does mean that early adopters of the iPhone 16 won’t be able to fool around with AI right away.

Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 3

Ever since 2016, iPhone events have also included a deep dive on the latest Apple Watch. This year looks to be no different. As a matter of fact, this is a big year for the Apple Watch. We are coming up on the gadget’s tenth birthday, so there are conflicting rumors as to whether the next entry will be called the Apple Watch Series 10 or the Series X.

No matter what it ends up being called, Apple’s next standard smartwatch is reported to have a bigger screen that’s more in line with the Ultra. It’s expected that the company will ditch the 41mm form factor and introduce a 49mm design.

Rumors have also suggested that Apple has completely redesigned the band system and added new connectors. This will likely make these straps easier to adjust, but there’s a downside. This move could make it so all of those old bands no longer work.

An Apple Watch. (Cherlynn Low / Engadget)

Of course, there’s going to be a new chip to power these watches, but we don’t have any specifics. It’s been suggested that these chips have been designed to accommodate Apple’s recent foray into AI, but that integration is likely to happen later on. For now, Apple Intelligence will be tethered to iPhone, iPad and Mac.

There are likely to be two watches revealed at the event, which are codenamed N217 and N218. It’s possible one of these will be the Apple Watch Ultra 3, though Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says the high-end smartwatch won’t get a major redesign this time out. It’ll likely be an iterative refresh.

On the software front, it looks like Apple has run into some snags while developing long-anticipated health tracking tools. Health monitoring is one of the key features of the Apple Watch, so the company has been working on new sensors to detect high blood pressure and sleep apnea. However, the tech will likely not be ready for this year’s smartwatch. Apple’s also been developing a glucose sensor for almost a decade so, who knows, maybe it’ll finally show up with the Series X.

Finally, it’s highly possible that Apple announces a new version of the budget-friendly Watch SE. This was last updated in 2022, so a refresh is overdue. There has been some reporting that Apple will be swapping out the aluminum exterior with a rigid plastic shell. This should help get costs down even further. As it stands, the Apple Watch SE is $250, but Samsung’s cheapest wearable is the $200 Galaxy Watch FE. Apple may want to compete closer to that price range.

AirPods 4

It’s been reported that Apple’s prepping two new variants of its standard earbuds. The AirPods 4 could feature both an entry-level model and a mid-tier version, which would effectively replace AirPods 2 and AirPods 3.

The big news here is that both AirPods 4 versions are likely to transition to a USB-C case to keep pace with the iPhone and the second-gen AirPods Pro. It’s been suggested that the cheaper of the two forthcoming models would lack wireless charging, but that the mid-tier version would support this technology. This is the same strategy Apple followed with previous generations, so it makes sense.

Both versions should feature similar designs, though the mid-tier variant is likely to support active noise cancellation like the Pro model. Speaking of, there will likely be no refresh of Apple’s high-end Pro earbuds at this event. There's also some mystery surrounding the company’s over-ear headphones, AirPods Max. It’s been four whole years since these premium cans hit store shelves (and they're still stuck using a Lightning port for charging), so a refresh is long overdue.

Surprises and software

The iPhone event doesn’t typically have a “one last thing” moment, but there’s one piece of hardware that could get a surprise shout out. It’s been rumored that Apple is preparing a massive redesign of the Mac mini. Analysts have suggested that this will be the company’s smallest ever desktop computer and could be around the same size of an Apple TV streaming box.

There will reportedly be two versions of the upcoming Mac Mini, one with the standard M4 chip and another with the more powerful M4 Pro chip. The base model is rumored to start shipping from suppliers this month, so it’s possible Apple will spend a few minutes on the computer at the iPhone event. However, don’t count on it. This is an event for iPhones and smartwatches and a miniaturized desktop could feel out of place. And, just like it did last fall, Apple could easily hold a Mac-specific event later this year.

Beyond that, a whole bunch of software updates are about to drop. There’s iOS 18, which we’ve written about extensively, and iPadOS 18. As for smartwatches, watchOS 11 is also coming out sometime this fall. Apple already detailed all three operating systems at WWDC, but the upcoming iPhone event would be a good time to announce official release dates."

According to Bloomberg, the “far thinner” iPhone 17 model planned for 2025 will sit between the entry-point iPhone 17 and the more expensive Pro models.

Earlier in May this year, The Information reported that Apple was planning “a significantly thinner version of the iPhone” slated for launch next year. However, the report added that it could well be the most expensive smartphone in Apple’s 2025 lineup. But the latest report from Bloomberg puts this skinnier iPhone model in the mid-segment as a replacement for the ongoing “Plus” model in Apple’s lineup. “The idea is to create an “Air” version of the iPhone of sorts,” says the report.

It further adds that Apple will market this new iPhone 17 model as “something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.” That’s the textbook definition of what the iPhone 15 Plus currently has to offer and the short-lived mini iPhones before it.

Jon Prosser at Front Page Tech also predicted the possibility of an iPhone Air happening in the near future. Apparently, Apple didn’t quite taste the sales success that it expected from the iPhone Plus models, which seems like a repeat of the “mini” strategy that also survived for only a couple of generations.

iPhone Air mockup Front Page Tech

Now, an “iPhone Air” sounds like an impressive proposition — one that is reminiscent of the iPad Air family, which hits the sweet spot between affordability and performance. Apple has positioned the “Air” slates between the vanilla iPad and the flagship iPad Pro models, combining top-shelf performance with a palatable asking price.

In the iPhone lineup, the iPhone Plus offers nothing compelling aside from a bigger display and a larger battery. However, the close price proximity with the “Pro” iPhones — which offer a faster processor, better cameras, and software features — pushed many buyers to get the latter at a smaller premium.

Notably, the iPhone 15 Pro could very well serve as the stepping stone for what iPhones will look like in the coming years. Apple will reportedly push the iPhone Air’s design across its entire smartphone portfolio, as per Bloomberg’s report. In addition to a thinner build, Apple is reportedly experimenting with a new battery design.

One of the core technologies in making the next-gen battery is called electrically induced adhesive debonding, and according to research, it could very well pave the way forward for batteries that are easily removable and replaceable."

With the iPhone 16 series expected to arrive in September (matching the last several generations), it might seem like the best time to invest in Apple's upcoming smartphone.

However, a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman on Sunday suggests that the next iPhone SE is on the way and it will be far more powerful than you might expect.

If you're a fan of finding the best cost-to-performance ratio, recent rumors surrounding this product make it seem like the iPhone 16 stands no chance against it.

The iPhone that can defeat iPhone 16

iPhone SE is a series of affordable phones that Apple began producing in 2016, solidifying itself as the cheapest option in the line-up of standard iPhone products.

Since then, a second generation launched in 2020, while a third came in 2022. It's been a few years, so it's no surprise that we're set to see the next generation arrive soon.

The iPhone SE 3 started at $429 when it launched in 2022. At the time, it was sandwiched between the launch of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, which began pricing at $799 (although the iPhone 13 did have a $699 mini model).

In essence, the iPhone SE is a crowdpleaser that hits a price point so alluring that budget-conscious Apple fans cannot help but be excited. And according to Gurman, we'll see it launch in early 2025.

We have no clue if it will maintain its $429 price point, but considering it's been three years, that may be unlikely. Gurman claims it could be a ""hot seller"" if Apple gets the price down to $500.

Gurman also states that the iPhone SE will look similar to an iPhone 14, alongside a ""crisper"" OLED panel that stretches across the entire front of the phone.

But what's most interesting about this leak is that Gurman claims the iPhone SE 4 will have Apple Intelligence. We don't know much about this upcoming budget phone, but that fact reveals more than you think.

What Apple Intelligence means on iPhone SE

Apple Intelligence is the company's upcoming AI initiative, implementing a handful of different features with the launches of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. However, the caveat of this exciting technology is that it's rather demanding.

On the official Apple Intelligence page, the company only lists the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max as being compatible with Apple Intelligence. This means that the base iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are not powerful enough to handle Apple Intelligence (this likely has to do with its weaker processor and less RAM).

But according to Gurman, the iPhone SE 4 is powerful enough to handle Apple Intelligence, which means it's more powerful than the iPhone 15 at the very least.

Compared to the iPhone 13, which launched before the iPhone SE 3, both featured an A15 Bionic Chip. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus boast an A16 Bionic Chip.

Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in Titanium

Compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max's A17 Pro chip, it's clear that these higher-end models are built with a greater ability to handle Apple Intelligence.

This means the iPhone SE 4 will have something more powerful than the A16 Bionic Chip, but will it go so far as to feature an A17 Pro?

Considering ""Pro"" is in the name, this is unlikely. Instead, we imagine that the iPhone SE 4 could feature a base A17 Bionic Chip, which will likely be featured in the base models of the upcoming iPhone 16 which is planned to be released in September.

AppleInsider predicts that the event will take place on September 10 and the phones will be released the following Friday, September 20.

If the base iPhone 16 does have an A17 Bionic, and the iPhone SE 4 also features an A17 Bionic, Gurman's leak is in line with what happened during the iPhone 13 and iPhone SE 3, as they featured the same chip and also came out after one another.

If that's the case, we also expect the A17 Bionic to feature 8GB of RAM like the A17 Pro, which has been rumored before, although it's possible it could be limited to 6GB like the A16 Bionic. However, this is unlikely considering RAM is important for AI features.

If this all ends up true, the result is the powerful iPhone SE 4 outmatching the recently launched iPhone 15 and doing so at a price point a few hundred dollars less than what it originally launched with.

While the iPhone 16 series will likely be great, we imagine the iPhone SE 4 will be an absolute hit with Apple fans who are less well-off and want a powerful smartphone without spending upwards of $800.

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is due an upgrade. | Credit: Apple

A lot has changed since the Apple Watch Ultra 2 launched in September 2023 – not least the introduction of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra as one of the best smartwatches around – and that means there's a lot of interest in what the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will bring.

Here we've collected together all the leaks and rumors we've heard so far about the wearable. Apple hasn't revealed anything officially yet, but we've got a pretty good idea about what the 2024 edition of this premium-level smartwatch is going to offer.

We've also put our heads together to come up with a list of features and upgrades we'd like to see from the Apple Watch 3. Even though we gave the current model 4.5 out of 5 stars in our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review, there's still room for improvement with the new edition.

Cut to the chase

What is it? A new Apple Watch Ultra

When is it out? Most likely September 2024

How much will it cost? Probably at least $799 / £799 / AU$1,399

Apple Watch Ultra 3: rumored release date and price

Two Apple Watch 9 models

Whatever else you can say about Apple, it certainly launches its products on a regular schedule – and so we'd expect to see the Apple Watch Ultra 3 in September 2024, following on from the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in September 2023, and the original Apple Watch Ultra, which launched back in September 2022.

Like previous models, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will almost definitely launch alongside new iPhones. This year, that's going to be the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Oh, and don't forget the Apple Watch 10 (we might even see the Apple Watch SE 3 show up too).

When it comes to pricing, we haven't heard anything specifically on this. We do know that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 starts at $799 / £799 / AU$1,399, and Apple typically matches its new devices to the devices they're replacing – so expect the Apple Watch 3 to be around the same price, or perhaps a little bit more expensive.

Apple Watch Ultra 3: leaks, rumors, and watchOS 11

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 on a person's wrist

While we'd like to report that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is set to be a revolutionary and innovative upgrade over the current model, in reality it might not be all that much different to the smartwatch it's replacing. Well-known sources are suggesting the 3rd-gen version will be more or less the same as the 2nd-gen one.

That goes for the internals as well as the design, apparently – good news if you love the Apple Watch Ultra 2, not-so-good news if you were hoping for a bit of a shake-up in 2024. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs on the same Apple S9 chip as the Apple Watch 9 does, up from the Apple S8 in the equivalent smartwatches launched in 2022.

One upgrade that has been rumored is a switch to a microLED display, from the current OLED tech. This would make the display on the new watch both brighter and kinder to the battery – a real win-win. However, it's not certain which Apple device will be the first to get microLED screens, which could also come to iPhones and iPads.

watchOS 11

Indeed, more recent reports suggest the microLED tech might not be ready in time for September 2024 – it's possible we'll have to wait for the Apple Watch Ultra 4 to see it on an Apple smartwatch. There has been some speculation that we wouldn't see the Apple Watch Ultra 3 at all this year, but it does now seem to be on the way.

It's all a little underwhelming, especially when changes in design and form factor have been rumored for the Apple Watch 10 (or should that be the Apple Watch X?). It's possible that Apple is saving major updates for the Apple Watch Ultra for 2025, rather than significantly transforming both of its watches at the same time.

What we do know is that watchOS 11 will arrive at the same time as the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch 10, bringing with it a more intelligent widget stack, a new Vitals app for displaying important health metrics, more customization options, and a Training Load feature for assessing the impact of workouts on your body.

Apple Watch Ultra 3: what we want to see

All the signs are that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 isn't going to be a huge jump forward in tech from the Apple Watch Ultra 2 – but we still have a few ideas about how Apple could improve its most capable smartwatch.

1. A cheaper price

Lower prices are always welcome, and while we do understand the premium materials used on the Apple Watch Ultra don't come cheap, surely Apple can find some compromises to offer a cheaper version of the Ultra? There's a not-insignificant $400 / £400 / AU$750 difference between the starting prices of the Apple Watch 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and an additional smartwatch model could bridge that gap nicely.

2. More design options

Apple Watch Ultra 2 review

Right now the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available with just one casing choice: standard silver titanium. The three straps (each available in three colors) give you some customization options, but we'd like to see more options when it comes to both the casing around the display and the straps you can get with it. If there's not much changing with the watch specs or design, then Apple can at least give users some more personalization options. Maybe an all-black option?

3. More exclusive features

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has a number of exclusive features to differentiate it from the Apple Watch 9, including an Action button and a siren button you can use to call for help. We'd like to see even more of these upgrades added to make the hefty price jump from the standard model worth it – perhaps in the form of exclusive apps for more advanced outdoor activity tracking, or a more advanced set of sensors for deeper health insights.

4. An improved Siri

Apple Intelligence presentation

We've heard plenty about the Apple Intelligence upgrades that are coming to Siri on iPhones, iPads and Macs later this year, but as yet there's nothing for the Apple Watch or watchOS 11. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 could be the perfect showcase for a smarter Siri that gives better answers and can provide more information – a key upgrade for a device where voice control is often preferable to tapping at the screen with your fingers and thumbs.

5. Better battery life

The up-to-36-hours battery life on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 isn't too bad at all, but it there wasn't any upgrade in this department over the original Apple Watch Ultra, and it still falls short if you want to take the wearable away for a few days in the mountains or into the middle of nowhere. A combination of a bigger battery capacity, a more efficiency chipset, and some software optimizations should be possible to extend battery life even further."

Huawei's next-generation Kirin chip will reportedly use a unified memory architecture (UMA), much like the Apple M-series silicon and Intel Core Ultra Series CPUs. It means that Huawei will bake in the RAM on the next-generation Kirin processors and make it available to the GPU and CPU. Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital (machine translated from Chinese), who also predicted that the Kirin CPU with Taishan V130 cores could match Apple M3 performance, said, ""This is a chip specially planned for AI terminal products, and the memory bandwidth is double that of previous PC chips.""

Huawei used to be one of the leading smartphone manufacturers in the world until the U.S. government slapped it with bans and sanctions because of its relationship with Beijing. The company was slowly building up its silicon at that time. Still, because it no longer had access to Qualcomm's and Intel's latest chips or the advanced chip production facilities at TSMC, Huawei was forced to focus on hardware research to build its processors.

Since then, the company has produced chips fully inside China, like the Kirin 9000S built using 7nm technology at SMIC. However, this means that its chips significantly lag behind the processors that used more advanced nodes from TSMC and other non-sanctioned fabs. Even its Ascend 910B AI processors suffer from bad yields, with 80% of chips made having defects.

Nevertheless, Fixed Focus Digital says in another Weibo post (machine translated from Chinese), ""The local large model and inference speed of AI is determined by memory bandwidth, and the use of UMA unified memory-DRAM on an IC substrate will have stronger synergistic performance than the chips currently used in Windows.""

It could mean that Huawei is building a chip designed to compete against Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processor, which has 45 TOPs NPU. But even if the company successfully produces a chip that can rival Apple and Qualcomm SoCs in performance, we're still unsure if it can use Microsoft's AI features, especially the Copilot+ PC branding.

That's because American lawmakers are not just trying to block advanced hardware from entering China; they also want to cut off the East Asian power from the American AI code.

Despite all the leaks, there is only one way we can know if Huawei's chip could face off with Apple's best — by running it on public benchmarks and comparing the results. But even though Huawei's new chips made outside of America's restrictions are much slower than their peers, it's still a wonder that the company could produce chips. Only time will tell if China will ever achieve performance parity with the U.S., but it seems that Huawei is taking the proper steps to catch up with AMD, Apple, Intel, and Qualcomm."

Earlier this year, the iPhone maker sent out a spyware warning to its customers in 92 countries around the world. Now Apple is back with another similar warning but this time, it’s gone out to iPhone users in even more countries.

Here’s everything you need to know about this new spyware warning along with how you can keep your own iPhone safe from hackers.

Same threat, new warning

A spyware alert displaying on a smartphone.

As reported by TechCrunch , Apple has sent out a new warning about mercenary spyware to iPhone users in 98 countries. Indian users were among them as many of the country’s journalists have been targeted by the infamous NSO Group and its Pegasus spyware in the past.

The warning says that “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack” which is designed to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID . It goes on to explain that the reason a particular user is being targeted is due to “who you are or what you do.”

Unlike with malware or phishing attacks , spyware is more expensive for hackers to deploy, which is why it’s normally reserved for high-value targets like journalists, politicians and activists.

It’s worth noting that in the past, Apple has referred to these incidents as “state-sponsored” attacks while this time, the company is calling them “mercenary spyware attacks.” While the language may have changed, the threat remains the same.

How to stay safe from spyware

When it comes to protecting the best iPhones from spyware, the first and most important thing you can do is to keep your smartphone updated and running the latest software. Apple often includes security patches in both major and minor iOS releases that can help keep you, your devices and the data stored on them safe.

If you are a high-value target or think that you could be, you should also consider enabling Apple’s Lockdown Mode on your iPhone. However, doing so does limit certain functions (like link previews in messages and just-in-time [JIT] JavaScript compilation in your browser) to minimize vulnerabilities which can be exploited by spyware. For those who are at serious risk though, this can be worth it as the alternative is much worse.

In addition to enabling Lockdown Mode, you should also consider signing up for Google’s Advanced Protection Program which is designed to help keep you safe from phishing attempts and harmful downloads. It also comes with some limitations and extra requirements that change how you use your Google account.

For most people though, a warning like this is more of a wake-up call than a serious threat. Just because iPhones are known for being very secure, it doesn’t mean that you should take unnecessary risks online. One other way that you can keep your iPhone and your Mac safe is by installing the best Mac antivirus software . While not every Mac antivirus can scan your iPhone for malware, Intego Mac Internet Security X9 and Intego Mac Premium Bundle X9 can.

Spyware is highly profitable and can extract all sorts of sensitive data from a targeted device, so don’t expect this threat to disappear anytime soon.

Cyber criminals are sending text messages to iPhone users in the U.S. that appear to be from Apple, but are in fact an attempt at stealing victims' personal credentials.

""Phishing actors continue to target Apple IDs due to their widespread use, which offers access to a vast pool of potential victims,"" Symantec said. ""These credentials are highly valued, providing control over devices, access to personal and financial information, and potential revenue through unauthorized purchases.""

Consumers are also more likely to trust communications that appear to come from a trusted brand like Apple, warned Symantec, which is owned by Broadcom, a maker of semiconductors and infrastructure software.

The malicious SMS messages appear to come from Apple and encourage recipients to click a link and sign in to their iCloud accounts. For example, a phishing text could say: ""Apple important request iCloud: Visit signin[.]authen-connexion[.]info/icloud to continue using your services."" Recipients are also asked to complete a CAPTCHA challenge in order to appear legitimate, before they're directed to a fake iCloud login page.

Such cyberattacks are commonly referred to as ""smishing"" schemes in which criminals use fake text messages from purportedly reputable organizations, rather than email, to lure people into sharing personal information, such as account passwords and credit card data.

How to protect yourself

Be cautious about opening any text messages that appear to be sent from Apple. Always check the source of the message — if it's from a random phone number, the iPhone maker is almost certainly not the sender. iPhone users should also avoid clicking on links inviting people to access their iCloud account; instead, go to login pages directly.

""If you're suspicious about an unexpected message, call, or request for personal information, such as your email address, phone number, password, security code, or money, it's safer to presume that it's a scam — contact that company directly if you need to,"" Apple said in a post on avoiding scams.

Apple urges users to always enable multi-factor authentication for Apple ID for extra security and to make it harder to access to your account from another device. It is ""designed to make sure that you're the only person who can access your account,"" Apple said.

Apple adds that its own support representatives will never send its users a link to a website and ask them to sign in, or to provide your password, device passcode, or two-factor authentication code.

""If someone claiming to be from Apple asks you for any of the above, they are a scammer engaging in a social engineering attack. Hang up the call or otherwise terminate contact with them,"" the company said.

Other tips for avoiding smishing scams, according to government watchdogs:

Set up your computer and mobile phone so that security software is updated automaticallyNever click links, reply to texts or call unknown phone numbers Never respond to unrecognized texts even if you're asked to ""text STOP"" to end the messagesDelete suspicious textsIf you get a text purportedly from a company or government agency, check your bill or go online to verify the contact information

The key to staying safe: ""Stop before you engage and avoid the urge to respond,"" according to the Federal Communications Commission.

A $35 million settlement fund will be established due to a class action lawsuit against Apple.

The 2019 lawsuit said iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus had audio issues, which Apple denied.

Some iPhone customers can receive up to $349.

Apple reached a $35 million settlement with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users who said their phones had audio problems. That means if you had one of those phones, you could get paid.

The lawsuit — available on the Settlement Administrator website — was first filed in 2019. It argues the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus had audio issues related to the ""audio IC chip."" The plaintiffs also accused Apple of violating consumer protection laws and breach of warranty.

Apple denied the phones had audio issues or that the company did anything wrong. Representatives for Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Nonetheless, Apple settled the case. Now attorneys for the plaintiffs said affected iPhone users could get up to $349.

""We are proud of the nationwide class action Settlement that is pending final approval before the Court, which if approved will provide Settlement Class Members who complained to Apple about the alleged audio defect up to $349 in monetary relief,"" attorneys Andrea Gold and Greg Coleman said in a statement.

Here's what iPhone customers need to know.

Who qualifies?

Apple customers in the United States who owned those phone models between September 2016 and January 2023 might be eligible to receive payment for the settlement.

The settlement administrator says customers must have reported the covered audio issues to Apple, including those who paid ""out of pocket"" for repairs and replacements related to the covered audio issues.

How much money could iPhone customers receive?

iPhone customers who paid Apple ""out of pocket"" for replacements and repairs related to the audio issue will receive ""an equal payment of at least $50 and no more than $349.""

Those who reported the audio issues to Apple but did not pay for repairs or replacements will receive ""an equal payment of up to $125.""

The $35 million settlement fund will be formally established if a judge grants approval during a hearing on July 18.

When is the deadline to apply?

The original deadline for customers who wanted to be included in the settlement was June 3, but the court approved an extension.

The new deadline is July 3, 2024.

Interested customers must provide the settlement administrator with payment information and their preferred payment method. This can be done via an online form or mailing it to the Tabak v. Apple Class Action Administrators.

Some customers included in the settlement may receive a postcard notification or email about the lawsuit.

If customers don't select a payment method and provide payment information, they'll remain in the settlement class but cannot receive payment. They will also waive their rights to sue Apple for the aforementioned issues in the future.

While it would be pretty clear what Apple product you want to buy — get an iPhone if you want a new smartphone, an iPad if you want a new tablet, or a MacBook if you want a new laptop — most of the time that you’ll spend on making your choice on what to purchase will stem from browsing through all the models that are available for each device. Of course, if you can afford the newest model for the Apple device that you want to buy, you should go for it in order to grab hold of the latest features. However, if budget doesn’t permit, it’s not a huge loss if you need to go back a generation or two, especially since they’ll still be supported by Apple’s updates for their operating system.

Apple devices usually end up in our best-of lists, such as the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in the best smartphones, the 2022 Apple iPad Air in the best tablets, and the Apple MacBook Air M3 in the best laptops. Their quality won’t be a problem, so what you should be looking for is whether they come with a warranty for your peace of mind. You should also be extra careful that you don’t end up buying a refurbished device when you want to get a brand new one. There’s nothing wrong with going for a refurbished Apple product if you want it at a lower price, but if the prices aren’t that different, you might as well buy a brand new device.

Another thing that you should consider is whether you have the appropriate accessories for the Apple device that you’re planning to buy. Apple has dropped the Lightning port in favor of a USB-C port in its most recent releases, so you may have to make an investment in new cables. Additionally, some accessories such as the Apple Pencil Pro will only work with certain models of the iPad, so if you already own the writing and drawing device, you should make sure that it will be compatible with the iPad that you buy."

They have gained momentum since the company released results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended Sept. 28) on Oct. 31.

Many investors have turned bullish about Apple's prospects after seeing those results, which revealed upticks in sales of iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks. Additionally, the company's services business achieved double-digit percentage year-over-year growth during the quarter.

But what are the prospects for Apple's major product lines for 2025? Can this technology giant sustain its recent rally and head higher next year?

Artificial intelligence could give Apple's sales a nice boost in 2025

Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year in its fiscal Q4 to $94.9 billion. Adjusted earnings increased 12% to $1.64 per share after excluding the one-time impact of the State Aid decision by the European General Court. Including the impact of that decision, Apple's diluted earnings came in at $0.97 per share, down from $1.46 per share in the same quarter last year.

For the fiscal year, revenue rose 2% to $391 billion, but adjusted earnings, shrunk to $6.08 per share from $6.13 per share in fiscal 2023 (including the impact of the European General Court decision). This shows how Apple's growth accelerated toward the end of the fiscal year, which was attributable to the stronger sales of iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads.

These sales will likely further benefit from the growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in 2025. The company started rolling out its Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features across these products in 2024, and more features will be made available in 2025. It is expected that the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence will eventually drive a jump in sales of iPhones.

For instance, IDC is expecting shipments of iOS-based iPhones to increase by 3.1% in 2025, while Android device shipments are only forecast to grow by 1.7%.

Favorable scenarios can be expected for MacBooks and iPads as well. That's because sales of these devices are set to get a boost thanks to AI in 2025. Gartner is forecasting a 165% increase in shipments of AI PCs in 2025 to 114 million units. Given that Apple is the fourth-largest PC OEM (original equipment manufacturer), it is well-placed to benefit from the secular growth of the AI-enabled PC market.

Meanwhile, the tablet market has also gained impressive momentum, with shipments increasing 20% year over year in the third quarter of calendar 2024 (per IDC). Apple is the top player in tablets, with an almost 32% market share. All this puts Apple in a nice position to capitalize on what Gartner forecasts will be a 9.5% jump in device spending next year, driven by customers looking to gain access to AI features.

Key Takeaways

Apple shares moved lower Monday morning, tracking a broader decline for U.S. stocks, but the company remains in striking distance of becoming the first ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.

A bearish evening star pattern has formed over the past three trading sessions, indicating a potential reversal in the stock.

Investors should watch key support levels on Apple's chart around $237 and $218, while also monitoring a chart-based bullish price target near $278.







Apple (AAPL) shares moved lower Monday morning, tracking a broader decline for U.S. stocks, but the company remains in striking distance of becoming the first ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.

Last Thursday, the company set a fresh record high just above $260 after Wedbush analysts led by Apple bull Dan Ives said that artificial intelligence (AI) demand sets the tech giant up for a “golden era of growth” in 2025. This week, investors will be watching if Apple shares can hit $264.62, the price need to reach a $4 trillion market cap.

The company first unveiled its AI-software marketed as Apple Intelligence back in June, but the rollout has been slow, with investors watching if a major upgrade cycle to access the features drives 2025 sales.

Apple shares were down 1.2% at $252.50 in midday trading Monday. Since the start of the year, Apple shares have gained around 31%, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s 24% increase over the same period.

Below, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify several important price levels that investors may be watching.

Evening Star Pattern Emerges

Apple shares have trended higher since breaking out above a broad ascending triangle formation earlier this month. However, a bearish evening star pattern has formed on the iPhone maker’s chart over the past three trading sessions, indicating a potential reversal.

Moreover, as the stock climbed to a record high last week, the relative strength index (RSI) made a comparatively shallower high to create a bearish divergence, a technical signal pointing to weakening price momentum.

It’s also worth noting volume spikes in the stock on June 21, Sept. 20, and Dec. 20, with these dates coinciding with triple witching days, suggesting portfolio rebalancing by larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds.

Let’s identify key support levels to watch if the stock undergoes a reversal, but also forecast a bullish price target to monitor if the shares continue their longer-term uptrend.

Key Support Levels to Watch

The first level to eye sits around $237. This location on the chart could attract buying interest near the 50-day moving average and the ascending triangle’s top trendline, an area that may flip from prior resistance into future support.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about.

As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned.

However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence.

Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement.

Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that ""rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing"" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. ""How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?"" wondered Cramer. ""It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added.

The company does not disclose which investment manager makes each individual trade, but Buffett is almost certainly in charge of large positions like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Despite once calling Apple the ""best business"" in the world, Buffett sold 100 million shares in the third quarter, cutting Berkshire's stake by 25%. And while Apple still ranked as the company's largest holding as of Sept. 30, Buffett has now sold more than 615 million shares in the last four quarters.

Meanwhile, Berkshire started a very small position in Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) in the third quarter. That stock is up 3,100% since its initial public offering (IPO) in July 2004, but it has struggled more recently. Shares have fallen 21% in the last three years, despite the S&P 500 advancing 28% during that period.

Here's what investors should know about Apple and Domino's.

Apple: The stock Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold in the third quarter

Apple has built brand authority and pricing power through engineering expertise. Its lineup of consumer electronics products is built on proprietary software that creates a seamless user experience across devices, and consumers are willing to pay for that. The average iPhone price was 3 times higher than the average Samsung smartphone price during the third quarter.

Apple has a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position (as measured by sales) in smartphones. However, the company in recent years has expanded its focus beyond hardware. Adjacent services like App Store downloads, iCloud storage, and Apple Pay let the company more efficiently monetize its installed base that exceeds 2.2 billion active devices.

Apple reported modest financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in September 2024. Revenue increased 6% on double-digit sales growth in the services segment, and mid-single-digit sales growth in the Mac, iPad, and iPhone segments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings increased 12% to $1.64 per diluted share.

Apple is a solid business, but not even the best business is worth buying at any price. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has risen from 26 in April to 42 in December without a meaningful catalyst. Sure, it recently launched Apple intelligence, a suite of artificial intelligence capabilities for newer iPhones and MacBooks. But that has yet to trigger the upgrade cycle predicted by so many analysts.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025.

• USD (AAPL) View Quote Details

“We believe Apple is heading into a multi-year AI driven iPhone upgrade cycle that is still being underestimated by the Street,” wrote Ives, continuing, “Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will Apple's AI strategy but the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.”

Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday — a record intraday high — before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap.

Apple is closing 2024 on a winning streak after a tough start to the year. It faced struggling iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and clashes with antitrust regulators at home and abroad. Early data from the initial rollout of Apple’s iPhone 16 lineup didn’t do much to bolster Wall Street’s confidence, with investment firm Jefferies (JEF) issuing a rare downgrade on the stock.

Other analysts, Ives included, stayed bullish on the stock as more positive iPhone shipment data engendered confidence in Apple’s artificial intelligence strategy for its consumer devices. Apple’s fourth quarter earnings report in early November showed the tech giant beating expectations on iPhone sales, despite missing estimates overall.

Shares began to climb in early November to new highs as Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro lineup and, in mid December, added ChatGPT and other Apple Intelligence AI features for the iPhone, iPad and macOS. Apple has outperformed several of its so-called Magnificent Seven peers over the past month. While Apple shares have gained more than 11% during that time frame, Meta (META) rose 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT) climbed 4.4%, Nvidia (NVDA) popped 1%.

Still, macroeconomic uncertainty could create headwinds for Apple. Trump’s tariffs on China could impact prices for Apple products assembled in the country, with the worst case scenario adding $256 of cost per iPhone. The US Federal Reserve’s projection that it would lower interest rates less than expected in 2025 also caused fears of persistent higher rates and sticky inflation, dampening consumer confidence heading into the new year."

The company has held that title for the better part of a decade but has yet to demonstrate it can monetize artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, I think the two AI stocks below can top Apple's current market value before the end of 2025:

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is currently worth $3.4 trillion. Its share price would need to increase 17% in the next year for the company to achieve a market value of $4 trillion.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is currently worth $2.4 trillion. Its share price would need to rise 67% in the next year for the company to achieve a market value of $4 trillion.

Admittedly, my first prediction is somewhat conservative, and my second prediction is very aggressive. Here's what investors should know about these AI stocks.

Nvidia: 17% implied upside before the end of 2025

Nvidia has been the foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads, and the company dominates the market for InfiniBand networking, which is currently the preferred connectivity technology for backend networks in AI data centers.

The company reported excellent financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in October 2024. Revenue increased 94% to $35 billion on particularly strong momentum in the data center segment, supported by strong sales growth in the automotive and robotics segment. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income doubled to reach $0.81 per diluted share.

Nvidia has a key catalyst on the horizon in the launch of its Blackwell GPU. Compared to the previous Hopper chip, Blackwell can complete AI training tasks up to four times faster and AI inference tasks up to 30 times faster. The production ramp up began in the current quarter, so Nvidia should see substantial Blackwell sales in the next year.

Morgan Stanley expects spending on cloud AI semiconductors to increase more than 50% next year. That paves the way for robust earnings growth from Nvidia. Indeed, Wall Street expects its adjusted earnings to grow 50% in the next four quarters. That consensus makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look cheap.

Nvidia's stock must reach $164 per share for the company to have a market value of $4 trillion. It will hit that mark if it meets Wall Street's earnings estimates and shares trade above 42 times earnings, which would be a large discount to the current valuation. Personally, I will be surprised if Nvidia doesn't blow past $4 trillion in 2025.

NVDA data by YCharts

Those eight tech giants have a combined weighting of 35.9% in the S&P 500, meaning investors who don't own them are almost certainly underperforming the index. Since themes like artificial intelligence (AI) will likely continue driving strong returns across the tech space, the very same scenario could play out in 2025.

Buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a high level of exposure to those trillion-dollar market leaders might be a simpler option for investors compared to buying them individually. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) offers exactly that -- more than one-third of the entire value of its portfolio is tied up in just three of the names in the chart.

Here's why it could be a great buy for investors of all experience levels.

Jam-packed full of leaders in tech and AI

The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF only holds 71 stocks, and 60% of its portfolio (by value) is invested in the technology sector. That isn't a surprise, considering its top three positions alone -- Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft -- account for 37.6% of its portfolio, and each of them is in the tech sector. Those three companies are among the leaders in different segments of the AI race.

Apple could become the largest distributor of AI to consumers via its Apple Intelligence software, while Nvidia is the leading supplier of data center chips for AI development. Microsoft, on the other hand, delivers AI services in the cloud, and it also built an AI assistant called Copilot that's driving productivity for enterprises.

(Reuters) - Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales.

The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization.

The latest rally in Apple shares reflects ""investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a ""hold"" rating.

Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets.

The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones.

In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology.

Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period.

Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite.

The company expects overall revenue to increase ""low- to mid-single digits"" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series.

However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025.

""Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's ""top pick"" heading into 2025.

The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations.

Santiago (Getty Images)

Apple’s (AAPL) artificial intelligence rollout could drive demand for the iPhone 16 this holiday season — and send the tech giant’s market value to a new record high.



Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a recent note that the Cupertino, California-based company “is set to have a strong holiday season ahead as iPhone 16 upgrades across its installed base are trending well into Christmas.”

In particular, Apple stands to sell upwards of 240 million iPhones in the 2025 fiscal year, fueled by AI-driven upgrades. The researchers said this could be “the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple’s history.”

Shares of Apple closed at $254.49 each Friday, up nearly 2%. So far this year, the company’s stock has surged 37%, lifting its market capitalization to $3.85 trillion. That makes it the most valuable company in the world, followed by Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Wedbush maintained its $300 price target, and said Apple is on track to become the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025.

Although iPhone sales jumped 6% year-over-year in the September quarter to $46.22 billion, the company’s annual revenue grew just 1% in the 2024 fiscal year.

While the company has been banking on its new AI features, known as Apple Intelligence, to supercharge sales, some analysts have warned that more substantial innovations will be needed to drive interest.

Wedbush said the “naysayers” are overlooking key opportunities within the company. With 2 billion iOS devices currently in use worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones, Wedbush believes that there are approximately 300 million iPhones that haven’t been upgraded within the past four years.

That, combined with a strong services business and the massive potential for Apple users to tap into AI through their iOS devices, could give Apple the boost it’s been gearing up for, the analysts said.

“We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launching pad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” they wrote.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Tencent and TikTok owner ByteDance about integrating their artificial intelligence models into iPhones sold in China, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

• USD (AAPL) View Quote Details

The U.S. company started the rollout of OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices this month, part of the Apple Intelligence product that allows its Siri voice assistant to tap the chatbot's expertise including on user queries about photos and documents such as presentations.

ChatGPT is not available in China and the country's regulatory requirements mandate that generative AI services obtain government approval before public release, forcing Apple to seek local partners for its AI features at a time when its market share in the country is declining.

Apple's discussions with Tencent and ByteDance on using their AI models are at a very early stage, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are not public.

ByteDance declined to comment, while Apple and Tencent did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

A successful partner for Apple's AI services in China could be a major winner in the country's increasingly crowded AI field where dozens of large language models have been launched by large tech firms as well as startups.

They include ByteDance's Doubao, Tencent's Hunyuan and search engine giant Baidu's Ernie.

Market share in China

Apple and Baidu have reportedly been in talks about using the latter's AI model in China, but The Information this month reported the discussions faced setbacks due to technical issues, including disputes over using iPhone user data to train AI models.

Baidu did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Baidu's Hong Kong-listed shares fell after the Reuters report, down 4.2% against a 0.6% decline in the Hang Seng index.. Tencent's shares rose 2.3%.

The absence of AI capabilities in the latest iPhones sold in China has become a major setback for Apple, as it faces declining market share in the world's biggest smartphone market due to growing competition from domestic brands including Huawei.

Huawei, which returned to the high-end market in August with a phone using a Chinese-made chip, launched its Mate 70 series last month featuring AI capabilities powered by its proprietary large language model.

Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter before recovering in the third quarter. The U.S. company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3% during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42%, according to research firm IDC.

As we enter one of the most-positive times of the year for the stock market, from December 19, 2024, until January 2, 2025, we note that the market has not been kind to average stock as well as many sectors since the latter part of November. Some blame it on tax-loss selling, which is probable. But there are sectors and indices falling from all-time highs, or at least 2024 highs, so there can?t be any tax selling there. NYSE breadth on Tuesday was -1,611 as the streak of weak breadth continues. The 12-day NYSE advances/total issues is down to 39%, one of the weakest readings over the past two years. And, once again, the weakest indices were the NYSE, S&P 400, and S&P 600. We see some interesting Commitment of Traders (COT) data as well as some disturbing da-ta (it just depends on which market). We mentioned previously that the major index combined hedger position was quite bearish -- and when we look at two of its index components, we find that the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 hedgers positions are both bearish as the smart money hedgers are at or near their most-negative futures positions.

Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) market capitalization has grown from $360 billion to $3.3 trillion, almost entirely because of soaring sales of its AI data center chips.

But the industry is evolving fast, so picking the long-term winners and losers won't be easy. That's why buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds several different AI stocks could be the best strategy for investors. It can offer exposure to the value created by AI in a diversified manner, which can insulate investors from severe losses if some companies fail.

The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) holds practically every top AI stock (including Nvidia), so here's why it might be one of the best choices for investors of all experience levels.

Several popular AI stocks packaged into one ETF

The iShares exchange-traded fund (ETF) has a relatively broad portfolio featuring 276 stocks. That's because it isn't specifically an AI fund -- its objective is to invest across the technology sector overall, in addition to the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. It just so happens that many of the largest companies in those market segments are laser focused on developing AI.

Despite holding hundreds of stocks, the iShares ETF is very concentrated. Its top three positions alone account for 25.3% of the value of its entire portfolio:

Stock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 8.73% 2. Nvidia 8.33% 3. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) 8.24%

Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 16, 2024, and are subject to change.

Meta, Nvidia, and Apple could be three of the most important names in AI over the long term. Meta created the world's most popular open-source large language model (LLM), called Llama, which has been downloaded more than 600 million times. The company is using it to create AI features for Facebook and Instagram, but Llama also provides businesses and developers with a cost effective way to create AI software.

Meta plans to launch Llama 4 next year, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg says could be the most advanced LLM in the entire AI industry. That would be an incredible accomplishment since many other companies (like OpenAI) had a head start of several years.

Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center are the most advanced in the industry for developing AI. The company just started shipping its new Blackwell chips, which offer a significant performance boost compared to its flagship H100, and sales are expected to ramp up extremely fast. That's why I think Nvidia could be one of the best performing stocks in the tech sector next year.

Probably not anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean Apple shares are due for a crash from the highs they’ve achieved this year, as some have predicted.

Apple stock, which closed at a record $251.04 on Monday, has gained more than 50% since bottoming out around $165 in April when the company launched Apple Intelligence—the name for its phone-based AI service—to underwhelming reviews. Overall, shares are up 35% on the year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 28% gain, and letting Apple reclaim its spot as the world’s most valuable company.

All of this reflects there is plenty of optimism surrounding Apple, despite flagging iPhone sales, which account for about half of the company’s revenue.

According to JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee, the optimism is warranted. He believes an AI revenue boost will arrive with the expected launch of the iPhone 17 in 2025, projecting that the product’s sales will surge from 230 million units in the company’s upcoming fiscal year, which started this quarter, to 251 million phones in the following 12 months.

Even if that doesn’t pan out, Chatterjee wrote in a note published on Monday, there is still a strong bull case for the stock. That story hinges on Apple’s services business—think of elements like technical support; content such as Apple Music, News, and TV; and payment products like Apple Pay and the company’s co-branded credit card. Revenue from those offerings, Chatterjee claimed, should be more resilient than many investors expect.

Does Buffett believe Apple is too expensive?

It’s unclear if famed investor Warren Buffett shares Chatterjee’s perspective. The Oracle of Omaha made headlines this year when he downsized his position in the company by more than two-thirds, fueling speculation about whether the stock has become unreasonably expensive. (It’s worth noting, however, that Buffett’s $74 billion stake in the company remains Berkshire Hathaway’s largest public holding.)

Apple currently trades at around 34 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months, according to consensus estimates from S&P Capital IQ. That makes the stock equivalent to or more expensive than that of nearly all of its fellow tech giants in the so-called Magnificent Seven—America’s largest companies by market cap—apart from Amazon (40 times) and Tesla (140 times).

Chatterjee currently maintains a $265 price target on the stock, implying a P/E ratio of 27 based on his earnings projections for 2026.

“We believe that the multiple is justified as it is more in line with the average multiple the shares have traded at in recent years; although, we see upside opportunity with a longer AI-led replacement cycle likely to bolster the earnings multiple investors are willing to ascribe,” he wrote.

Elon Musk doesn't hold back when it comes to Apple. From calling the company the ""Tesla Graveyard"" to criticizing its AI plans and reflecting on his unpleasant encounter with Steve Jobs, Musk's comments make it clear that the rivalry between these tech giants is personal, professional and competitive.

Back in 2015, during an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Musk mocked Apple's hiring practices. Referring to its recruitment of former Tesla employees, he said:

""They have hired people we've fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard.' If you don't make it at Tesla, you work at Apple. I'm not kidding.""

Don't Miss:

This came from reports that Apple was working on its electric vehicle project, ""Titan."" Musk didn't stop at staffing digs; he also questioned Apple's ability to break into the auto industry, saying, ""Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch? No, It's good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches. You can't just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: Build me a car.""

At the time, Apple declined to comment.

Musk's critiques haven't just been aimed at Apple's business strategies. In an interview with GQ that same year, he recalled meeting Steve Jobs at a party before Jobs' death in 2011. The encounter wasn't what Musk had hoped for. ""[The] one time I met Steve Jobs, he was kind of a jerk,"" Musk said.

See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

He later tried to soften his remark, explaining that his observation was based on a ""personal experience."" He added that Larry Page, cofounder of Google, had introduced him to Jobs several years earlier and Jobs may not have even known who he was then.

Fast-forward to today and Musk's criticisms of Apple have shifted to its push into artificial intelligence. After Apple announced updates to Siri that included integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, Musk voiced concerns about user privacy and security. Writing on his platform, X, he called the collaboration ""an unacceptable security violation"" and accused Apple of having ""no clue what's actually going on."""

United States Steel became the first-ever $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later in 2018, Apple became the first company in the world to reach a valuation of $1 trillion.

Apple is now worth over $3.7 trillion, and six other technology companies have joined it in the trillion-dollar club: Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia. But I think another one could soon earn its membership.

Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was founded in 1977 and it has participated in almost every technological revolution ever since. Now, it's quickly becoming a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure, which could catapult the company to a $1 trillion valuation in under a decade.

Oracle's market capitalization is currently $492 billion, so investors who buy its stock today could double their money if it does join the trillion-dollar club.

Oracle's AI infrastructure is best-in-class

Large language models (LLMs) are at the foundation of every AI chatbot and software application. Developers keep building larger LLMs to make AI software ""smarter,"" but it's a very expensive exercise that requires data centers filled with thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs).

Nvidia supplies the world's most powerful GPUs for developing AI. The more of them a developer can access, the more data their LLMs can ingest and process. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to 65,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs, which is the highest number in the industry.

But Oracle is about to go a step further. It's currently building new clusters that will allow developers to use up to 131,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs.

OCI's random direct memory access (RDMA) technology is also much faster than traditional Ethernet networks when it comes to moving data from one point to another. Since most developers rent computing capacity on a per-minute basis, faster processing translates to substantial cost savings. That's why Oracle has attracted leading AI start-ups like xAI, OpenAI, Cohere, and more.

During its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended Oct. 31), Oracle said GPU usage was up by a whopping 336% compared to the year-ago period, which highlights how quickly demand is climbing for AI infrastructure. The company currently has 98 data center regions in operation, but it plans to build another 1,000 to 2,000 over the long term to meet that demand.

The trades above are detailed in the latest Forms 13F completed by each hedge fund. While those forms were filed recently, the trades took place at least two months ago. So, here is a more up-to-date look at Apple and Tesla.

1. Apple

Apple has cultivated brand authority and pricing power by developing a ecosystem of tightly integrated hardware, software, and services. The company has a strong presence in consumer electronics categories like smartphones and personal computers, as well as adjacent markets like financial services, streaming media, and mobile app distribution and advertising.

However, Apple is beset by headwinds. For instance, vertical integration of hardware and services has traditionally been a competitive advantage for the company. But the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe has weakened that advantage by forcing Apple to permit third-party app stores on its devices, and to allow alternative in-app payment methods. Similar legislation has been introduced in the U.S., which could be problematic for Apple if implemented.

Additionally, Apple's services business is driven in large part by Alphabet. Apple receives up to $20 billion annually for making Google the default search engine on its devices, but that revenue could disappear. Federal Judge Amit Mehta recently ruled that Alphabet had an illegal monopoly in internet search. The appeals process may last years, but Alphabet's ability to pay for default search placement will likely be limited, if not completely prohibited.

Finally, some analysts have framed the introduction of Apple Intelligence -- a suite of artificial intelligence features for its devices -- as the catalyst for an iPhone upgrade cycle of epic proportions. However, those expectations not only seem overbaked, but also have been priced into the stock several times over.

When the computer company from Cupertino, California, began trading on the Nasdaq on Dec. 12, 1980, it was the biggest IPO since the Ford Motor Company went public in 1956. As The Wall Street Journal famously put it, “Not since Eve has an Apple posed such temptation.”

The hype proved to be entirely justified. Apple is today the largest company in the world, becoming the first firm to reach a $3 trillion valuation in 2022—four years after it was the first U.S. corporation to surpass the $1 trillion threshold. Those who bet on Apple’s success 44 years ago—and even much later—have been richly rewarded.

If you had invested $10,000 of today’s dollars in Apple when the company went public at $22 a share, your investment would now be worth $32.7 million, according to calculations by Fortune using data from S&P Capital IQ. The analysis accounts for Apple’s five stock splits and assumes the reinvestment of all dividends, based on the stock’s price at close Wednesday.

The gains are impressive in comparison to the broader market. Since November 1982, the earliest that data from Bloomberg is available, Apple shares have yielded a total return of 20% on an annualized basis. That number is 12% for the S&P 500 over the same span, meaning Apple has grown nearly twice as fast on average each year.

In recent years, the tech giant's growth has been especially spectacular. Since the unveiling of the iPhone in January 2007, Apple's year-over-year return has averaged 24% compared to the S&P 500's 10%.

Warren Buffett cashes in on Apple gains

Therefore, even investors who got in decades after Apple went public have witnessed huge gains. That includes Warren Buffett, whose $40 billion bet on the company, including purchases from 2016-18, has paid off handsomely for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

At the end of the last year, Berkshire’s Apple holding was worth $174.3 billion. The Oracle of Omaha has sold-off more than two-thirds of that position since, but Berkshire’s 300 million Apple shares—worth about $74 billion as of Wednesday’s close—remains the largest piece of the conglomerate’s portfolio.

Berkshire’s position at the start of 2024 would currently be worth over $220 billion, but Buffett likely won’t fret about missing the upswing. Stock sales propelled Berkshire’s profits to $26.25 billion last quarter, compared to a loss of $12.77 billion during Q3 a year ago. As Fortune’s Shawn Tully recently noted, Buffett’s Apple gambit will likely go down as one of the best wagers in the storied investor’s career.

The slightly harsh lighting and drab carpeting are straight out of the 1990s, and the not-especially-trendy clothing is stacked and hung on shelves, racks, and fixtures that wouldn’t have been out of place in the golden age of Sears.

But a Dillard’s is also a throwback in a good way: The aisles aren’t overflowing with a noisy flock of 30%-off discount signs. Unlike at too many of its rivals, there aren’t mounds of unfolded, unattended sweaters on the floor. And above all, there are a lot of staff around—quick to help, speedy in tidying up after messier shoppers, and ensuring you aren’t waiting at a cash register for an eternity.

Dillard’s isn’t a nationwide household name: It doesn’t operate stores on the West Coast or anywhere on the East Coast north of Virginia. But it’s a giant in the South and Southwest—and more important, it’s thriving in an era when department store retail has teetered on the edge of extinction. If its stores aren’t flashy, that’s the point, and its secret sauce. Dillard’s stores have struck the right balance between meeting shopper needs and avoiding clutter: They have enough inventory and enough variety in sizes and colors to project abundance, not chaos.

This is how a family-owned and -run department store—a department store!—is thriving in the year of our Lord 2024. Focusing on basics like well-run stores and on merchandise customers want, and undistracted by the latest fads, Dillard’s has been able to take market share from rivals like Macy’s and Nordstrom. In early December, when activist investor Barington Capital went public with an effort to push Macy’s to change its business, it made a presentation to Macy’s shareholders that included a clear message: Be more like Dillard’s.

“They’re not the most exciting of retailers, or innovative, and they’re old-fashioned,” says GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders. “But Dillard’s has never sacrificed investment in its stores.”

For investors, backing Dillard’s hasn’t involved many sacrifices lately. Since January 2021, Dillard’s shares have risen 604%, compared with the S&P 500’s 57% increase, and they remain close to their all-time high. Over the same stretch, Macy’s shares are down 25%, Nordstrom down 34%, and Kohl’s down 62%. What’s more, Dillard’s has also outperformed Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, and just about every stock not named Nvidia over the past four years.

In physical retail, of course, performance is relative. Like other department stores, Dillard’s is grappling with a consumer pullback on some discretionary spending, notably for apparel, and the continued drift of some shoppers to Amazon or the sites and stores of individual brands. Over the long term, the sector’s decline is incredibly striking: Department stores’ share of U.S. retail spending fell to 2.3% in 2023, down from 9.8% two decades earlier. In recent years, Belk and JCPenney have sought bankruptcy protection only to emerge as much smaller chains, while Lord & Taylor went out of business altogether, and Sears is a shadow of its former self.

Story Continues

In this beleaguered sector, though, treading water counts as a victory: In 2023, Dillard’s sales came in at $6.75 billion, a touch below the prior year; and so far this year its retail sales are down 3%. (Macy’s and Nordstrom, Dillard’s two biggest rivals, have both seen improvement in 2024 after several tough years.)

More tellingly, Dillard’s sales and store count are roughly where they were a decade ago, whereas its rivals’ numbers have shrunk considerably. And Dillard’s has reported three consecutive years of well above average profits, with operating margins outpacing those of rivals. The company’s stellar recent returns show that investors have recognized the big gap between Dillard’s and its competition.

How does Dillard’s do it? Its management and ownership aren’t exactly revealing their secrets. Both the company and the family that owns it are unusually press-shy. Indeed, Dillard’s is one of only 21 publicly traded companies in the Fortune 1000 that don’t hold quarterly earnings calls where they take questions from investors. (Dillard’s media relations executive did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment or fact-checking questions for this article.)

The hints Dillard’s leaders drop in earnings reports are anodyne: “We are the place where customers are far more motivated by fashion and newness than by price or promotional measures,” William Dillard II, the septuagenarian CEO of 26 years and son of the founder, wrote in a letter to shareholders in Dillard’s annual report earlier this year.

Still, analysts and competitors who eagerly watch the company have noticed some patterns. Given the founding family’s tight control, Dillard’s hasn’t fallen under pressure from Wall Street to chase faster growth with waves of discounts that erode the stores’ cachet. (Like many of its rivals, Dillard’s operates some outlet stores; unlike many competitors, it only does clearance racks and big discounts at the outlets, not in its full-size stores.) The company’s strong use of inventory tech has also kept its profit margins high.

“They do retail right,” says Burt Flickinger, a veteran analyst and cofounder of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. Dillard’s success shows that the department store format still has legs, and it just might offer a blueprint to its struggling peers.

From small-town store to pioneer

Dillard’s history goes back to pre–World War II, small-town Arkansas. Founder William Thomas Dillard borrowed money from his father in 1938 to open a clothing store in the hamlet of Nashville. The Great Depression’s effects were still pinching consumers, but Dillard had considerable experience to draw upon: He had earlier gone through a management training program at Sears and had an MBA from Columbia University.

He sold that small first store 11 years later and then bought out his partners in a larger Texarkana department store in which he had also invested, with his eye on larger markets. He then quickly expanded that chain, the kernel of what is now Dillard’s, in Texas and the South, in much the same way that Nordstrom became the regional leader in the Northwest and Lord & Taylor in the Northeast. (The company’s headquarters are still in Arkansas, having moved to Little Rock in 1964.)

Two factors helped Dillard’s emerge as the South’s dominant chain. The company was quicker than competitors to open stores in malls in the 1960s as suburbanization accelerated, while also being adept at choosing higher-quality malls that could ride out recessions. What’s more, William Dillard understood early how much technology could give him an edge, adopting systems that computerized checkout and tracked inventory before other department stores did. To this day, analysts say, Dillard’s has industry-leading inventory management software, enabling it to reduce the need to sell items at clearance and to more easily offer shoppers more new merchandise—a key reason for the recent surge in Dillard’s profitability. Another way he was innovative: In 1961, he launched Dillard Investment Co., making the company one of the first retailers to offer customers store credit cards.

Although Dillard’s went public in 1969, it is still effectively run like a private company. It has long been a family affair: William Dillard II, the current CEO, would visit stores with his father as a preteen. Family members together own more than 81% of voting rights in the company. In addition to the founder’s direct offspring, three of his grandchildren are now Dillard’s executives. The tight-knit ownership has led to a secretive culture: The company does not even announce the date of its quarterly earnings reports via press release until the evening before.

Other than local news reports of Dillard family members’ participation in philanthropy, the family stays out of the news and certainly never seeks press, earning them the moniker of “the Dullards” in Arkansas.

At the same time, tight family ownership of voting shares has shielded it from outside pressure to pursue ill-advised strategies (much as fellow Arkansas retailer Walmart has been buffered by the sizable Walton family stake in that company). While Macy’s has repeatedly had to face down activist investors trying to make it sell off its stores, the Dillards have been left in peace, in full command of their family enterprise.

Family control also enabled the company to keep its focus on the South, without shareholder pressure to go national. That kind of pressure has sometimes led their competitors down expensive cul-de-sacs: Macy’s, for example, tried opening a separate chain of T.J. Maxx–like discount stores called Backstage (those stores are now housed within Macy’s regular locations rather than being stand-alone); while Nordstrom face-planted with a Canadian expansion it later dropped. Dillard’s, meanwhile, has stuck to its core business and done well.

Family affair

Dillard’s strong performance comes despite factors that theoretically could have led it astray. For one thing, the Dillard’s C-suite includes five family members, all but one in their seventies. (The Dillard’s board is similarly made up of older people who’ve been there for eons, with six of 15 directors being members of the Dillard family.) That’s often a recipe for insularity, potentially leading to management and a board that are nonresponsive to changes in the market. Dillard’s counters that theory in its 2024 annual report: There, the company says that the fact that its ranks of senior executives are thinner than at other retailers puts “executive management closer in the chain of command” to store associates, making it nimbler.

That the Dillard family prefers to focus on the core business and not chase growth fads could stem from a close call with a cash crunch a generation ago. In a bid to expand, Dillard’s in 1998 paid $2.9 billion to buy the 100-location Mercantile Stores chain—its biggest acquisition ever. That deal brought its store count to an all-time high of 342 locations, and revenue to its apex of $8.5 billion in 1999.

But the debt from that deal proved crushing, with the interest expense diverting investment away from stores. Dillard’s briefly fell into the discounting trap. And by 2003, some Wall Street analysts began speaking of a restructuring or the possibility that Dillard’s would need to put itself up for sale.

The Mercantile acquisition had made sense at the time, given that it came during a period of department store consolidation, when the ethos was buy or be bought, or miss out on the land grab. In 2005, Macy’s parent company bought May Department Stores for $17 billion. That deal led to a backlash from customers angry over their stores being rebranded Macy’s (Chicagoans who loved Marshall Field’s, to name but one example, took years to accept Macy’s). It also left the chain with too many stores, part of why Macy’s is still closing locations two decades later.

Dillard’s eventually recovered from that big acquisition, but it never attempted another and has kept debt to a minimum since. It closed a few stores a year for a stretch in the 2000s, and eventually the fleet went back to its earlier size, as did top-line revenue. Today, Dillard’s store count is roughly where it was in 2004, while Macy’s is undertaking yet another round of closings, this one involving 150 of its stores in the next three years.

Moving upscale

Dillard’s relatively strong performance over the past few years has helped it snag choice merchandise from suppliers. “Vendors know that Dillard’s pays on time and in full, so they are willing to advance Dillard’s more inventory,” says SRG’s Flickinger.

That in turn has helped Dillard’s tap into a white space in the market. “Dillard’s has worked to move its product offering more upscale, focusing on the market opportunity between Macy’s and Nordstrom,” JPMorgan analyst Matt Boss wrote in a recent research note. And that is a reason Nike started selling its goods in Dillard’s again in 2023, three years after the sportswear company ill-advisedly dropped its Dillard’s accounts as part of its campaign to sell more at its own online and physical stores.

The upshot: While Dillard’s stores may seem staid, the brands they sell can skew fancy. Dillard carries rising brands like activewear apparel company Rhone, upscale clothiers Hickey Freeman, Boss, Armani Exchange, luggage-maker Tumi, and suit-maker Hart Schaffner Marx, alongside home-goods brands like Southern Living.

Dillard’s also does well with its in-house store brands, which generate 23.6% of sales, compared with 15% at Macy’s and 10% at Nordstrom, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Store brands offer higher profit margins, so when they catch on with consumers, as they have at chains like Dillard’s and Target, they offer a retailer stronger results. “Dillard’s higher quality and distinctive designs likely explain its relative outperformance,” posits Bloomberg Intelligence.

Avoiding a doom loop

Many retailers have found themselves in a bit of a customer-service doom loop. As sales decline, they cut back on employee expenses to protect margins, compromising customer-service levels, which in turn makes shoppers less likely to return, hurting sales and so on.

But Dillard’s 29,600 employees literally have skin in the game: Collectively, they own some 30% of the company’s nonvoting shares, a fairly rare phenomenon in retail. (The company regularly pays substantial special dividends to all its shareholders.) Bloomberg Intelligence said in a recent note that the “culture of employee ownership” is one of its biggest competitive advantages. And that has helped it maintain a high level of presentation, including relying on visual merchandisers who put together appealing vignettes that make Dillard’s stores more welcoming.

However much the aging Dillard clan is unmistakably in control, the company has a strong talent development culture and a team that understands how a department store can carve a place for itself among shoppers. “They are the last great combination of family and professional management,” says Flickinger, the retail analyst.

Such talent also helps Dillard’s remain connected to the broader culture. Dillard’s has collaborated with influencers and other celebrities to promote products from its store labels—enlisting popular stylist Mary Glenn McElveen, for example, to work with its women’s clothing and footwear brand Antonio Melani.

Dillard’s still has some weaknesses—though none seems too big to manage. Its e-commerce is still a relatively small percentage of sales compared with rivals, at 30%. Dillard’s remains a mall-based retailer at a time malls, even good ones, are not out of the woods. (When other retailers and sellers flee a mall, overall visits by shoppers tend to drop, hurting even the stronger tenants.) And its C-suite and board, dominated by octogenarians, won’t be around forever, creating the potential for stumbles during leadership transitions. (William Dillard III, a grandson of the founder and a senior vice president, is a mere baby, in his early fifties, and is rising up the ranks.)

Dillard’s remains a black box, a most opaque publicly traded retailer. But it has survived the department store meltdown by concentrating on what it does best. And that is clearly its best way forward long term while continuing to offer investors outsize returns.

“This is their store, this is their business, and they run it on their terms,” says GlobalData’s Saunders. “Their attitude is, ‘We’re running this business, and if you want to invest in it, fine. If not, that’s also fine.’”

Key Takeaways

Apple shares may remain on watchlists Tuesday after setting a new all-time high yesterday and registering their 21st record close of the year.

The stock broke out from a five-month ascending triangle earlier this month, signaling a continuation of the iPhone maker's longer-term uptrend.

The measuring principle, which calculates the depth of the ascending triangle near its widest section and adds that amount to the pattern’s top trendline, projects a price target of $278.

Investors should watch key support levels on Apple's chart around $237, $218, and $197.







Apple (AAPL) shares could remain on watchlists Tuesday after setting a new all-time high (ATH) yesterday and registering their 21st record close of the year.

Sentiment surrounding the stock may have received a boost after Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" in a recent interview that the iPhone maker sits well positioned to benefit from a multi-year cycle of product launches, adding that the company’s integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT provides potential revenue opportunities through pro-version upgrades.

Apple shares traded sideways for most of the third quarter as investors digested the delayed rollout of the tech giant’s highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features and its impact on device sales. However, the stock has regained its upward trajectory, rallying more than 12% from its early November low and trading 28% higher since the start of the year as of Monday’s close.

Below a take a closer look at the technicals on Apple’s chart and identify key price levels that investors may be watching out for.

Ascending Triangle Signals Bullish Continuation

Apple shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle earlier this month, signaling a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend.

The stock has continued to move higher, albeit on lackluster volume, with the price completing a bullish engulfing pattern as it set a fresh record high in Monday’s trading session.

While the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could lead to near-term profit taking.

Let’s apply technical analysis to project where the stock’s price may be headed next if the current continuation move plays out and also identify three key support levels that could attract buying interest during retracements.

Chart-Based Price Target to Watch

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, showing that demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips remains strong.

The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion). Still, the sales numbers were down 12% from October's figures.

However, revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year to NT$2.62 trillion.

November Sales Jump Comes After CEO Called AI Demand 'Real'

The numbers come after TSMC in October projected a buoyant outlook, with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei calling the demand for AI ""real"" in the third-quarter earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.

Tech companies have dramatically increased their spending on AI infrastructure this year as they've raced to satisfy surging demand for the emerging technology as well as cloud computing, but investors have been worried that the huge investments may not pay off.

U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

While the GDPR is a European-focused set of rules, consumers all over the world have seen beneficial side effects. One of those is that Apple has opened up its NFC technology to third parties, resulting in the first-ever alternative to Apple Pay on the iPhone.

Vipps is a Norwegian-based firm and the first company to have a tap-to-pay solution on the iPhone besides Apple itself. For now, the service only supports Norwegian banks, but it’s expected to grow in time and spread to other payment providers across Europe.

Part of this change is informed by Apple’s ongoing legal issues in different parts of the world. For example, Apple is under fire for alleged anti-competitive policies in India, similar to a suit filed in the European Union. However, it’s also clear that this change has been ongoing for quite some time — and the ability for third-party companies to create their own payment apps isn’t limited to just Europe.

Apple

Users of the iOS 18.2 beta already have the option to set a default contactless payment app, and that setting will presumably remain in place when the full version of iOS 18.2 goes public. While Apple Pay is an extraordinarily effective app, it’s always better for users to have more options than less.

Vipps has already announced its intention to extend the service into Denmark, Finland, and Sweden next year. Vipps is only the first company to launch an app like this. That said, it would be no surprise to see several alternatives pop up in the months ahead, especially if those are sponsored by banks or other financial organizations."

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has shared insights on the company’s future, touching on the iPhone 16’s new camera button, Vision Pro sales, and AirPods’ evolution.

What Happened: In an interview with WIRED published on Wednesday, Cook was asked about the decision to add a physical button to the iPhone 16 for camera control—a stark departure from Steve Jobs' aversion to buttons.

Cook replied, ""I don't know what Steve would have thought,"" but believed the change was essential for improving user experience.

Don't Miss:

On generative AI, Cook described it as ""a wave"" that grew over time. He noted Apple's foresight in incorporating a neural engine into its products back in 2017, recognizing early that AI and machine learning would revolutionize technology.

The Apple CEO also addressed reports of slower-than-expected Vision Pro sales, describing it as a product for early adopters. ""The ultimate test for us is the ecosystem.""

Regarding AirPods' future role in addressing hearing loss, Cook framed it as a democratization of health. The tech giant aims to reduce the stigma of traditional hearing aids and encourage self-diagnosis.

See Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.

When asked about his tenure as CEO, Cook admitted he hasn't set a firm timeline for his departure. ""I'll do it until the voice in my head says, ‘It's time,'"" he said. ""But it's hard to imagine life without Apple.""

Why It Matters: Earlier last week, speculations rose about Cook’s potential retirement and the search for his successor. At 63, his tenure has surpassed that of many Fortune 500 CEOs.

Last month, Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, surpassing analysts’ projections of $94.56 billion. The tech giant also reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share for the quarter, exceeding the anticipated $1.60 per share.

In 2024, shares have produced a total return of 27% (as of Dec. 4). That kind of gain certainly draws the attention of investors looking at where to park their capital as they set their sights on 2025.

The hope for Apple bulls is that there's another strong showing on the horizon. Where will this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock be in one year?

Apple is a mature business

It has been 17 years since Apple first released the iPhone, which might be the single greatest product launch ever. This device remains the key financial driver for the overall company, representing 51% of Apple's total sales in fiscal 2024.

On the one hand, the success of the iPhone means that Apple has broad distribution. The business is quite literally in the hands and pockets of consumers across the globe, which is the envy of any company. Apple successfully uses this distribution to push its various software and services, creating a fast-growing, high-margin, and recurring revenue stream.

On the other hand, because the iPhone is now in a much later stage of its lifecycle, it's simply not able to introduce new game-changing features that get consumers excited. Going from zero to one its revolutionary, but moving from 15 to 16, for example, can be a marginal change.

This doesn't boost demand for Apple that can move the needle in a big way. The company's total revenue in fiscal 2024 was 2% higher than the year before. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI initiatives, perhaps there could be a major bump-up in consumer demand to buy the latest version of the iPhone.

Regardless of what the latest trends reveal, Apple's growth prospects remain muted. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, the company is projected to increase revenue at a compound annual rate of 7% over the next three fiscal years. That's not a lot to get excited about.

Expectations and predictions

There's no denying that Apple has been a moneymaking machine this century, compounding shareholder capital in tremendous fashion. But what are the stock's prospects over the next 12 months?

It doesn't help investors that Apple currently trades at a steep valuation. the stock sells at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. The valuation has rarely been higher in the past 15 years. And the current P/E multiple represents a 100% premium to the average since December 2009. Things are expensive, particularly in light of Apple's soft growth prospects.

Economic data releases and earnings

You cannot pin all the credit on Apple (AAPL) for the surging stock prices this year for AT&T (T) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

I would actually argue Apple deserves none of the credit. Sorry, not sorry, Tim Cook!

Who deserves the credit? The top brass at each company that have been focused on running more beastly telecom operations. I am talking about a maniacal focus on profit margins, free cash flow generation, and expansion of potentially lucrative opportunities. And in turn, there has been zero focus on doing dumb things with shareholder money like expanding into the media business.

First up in this analytical drill-down is Dallas, Texas-based AT&T, led by company veteran John Stankey.

At an investor day this week, Stankey used his trademark deep voice (see video above) to outline more than $40 billion to be returned to shareholders over the next three years via stock buybacks and dividends. What really caught my attention was the guidance for double-digit percentage earnings growth in 2027.

AT&T and double-digit earnings growth normally aren't heard in the same sentence.

Execs are betting that investments in 5G infrastructure and fiber will yield a quicker pace of sales and earnings growth than seen in 2024.

For Stankey, the year-end investor day capped his continued efforts to pivot back to simply being a telecom giant.

In April 2022, AT&T closed its deal to spin off its WarnerMedia division, which it had purchased for a colossal $85 billion just three years earlier. The move combined WarnerMedia's HBO and CNN with Discovery's HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC.

The deal has been a full-on disaster for CEO David Zaslav who leads the now Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

Since the spin-off, AT&T has zeroed in on reducing debt, partly from the WarnerMedia acquisition. In September, AT&T sold its majority stake in TV provider DirecTV to private equity firm TPG for $7.6 billion.

AT&T's long-term debt now stands at $126 billion, down from more than $128 billion in 2022.

""I can say that we are back in growth mode,"" Stankey told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. ""I think we're early innings in our success story, so I don't think it's mission accomplished.""

Stankey added he's bullish on the Trump administration providing tailwinds to his business, especially if tax cuts are extended."

That wasn't always the case. Just 20 years ago, General Electric and ExxonMobile were the leaders in terms of market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively.

These days, technology rules the roost. Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are each worth more than $3 trillion and led the leaderboard at some point in 2024. Other big tech members of the $1 trillion club are also household names, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, with valuations of between $1.5 trillion and $2.3 trillion.

With a market cap of roughly $797 billion (as of this writing), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) seems a shoo-in for membership in this exclusive fraternity. The company supplies a broad cross-section of products that are critical components in data center infrastructure, where most AI processing takes place, and its indispensable technology could be the fuel that drives Broadcom's successful quest for membership.

Chip shot

As well as being one of the world's foremost custom chipmakers, Broadcom also offers a host of complementary products and services in the mobile, cable, broadband, and data center segments. The company states that ""99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology."" This extensive reach illustrates why Broadcom's technology is a critical part of the generative AI ecosystem, as the technology lives primarily in the cloud and in data centers.

Beyond AI, investors continue to underestimate the opportunity represented by Broadcom's purchase of VMWare late last year. During the recent earnings call, management noted that ""VMWare bookings continue to accelerate,"" amounting to $2.5 billion in Q3, up 32% sequentially.

Furthermore, the company continues to drive down VMWare spending. CEO Hock Tan noted that with the VMWare integration proceeding as expected, Broadcom was on track to deliver on its goal of $8.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by 2025. Once the process is complete, the company expects to deliver expanding margins and increasing profits.

The results highlight an intriguing opportunity. For its fiscal third quarter (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom delivered revenue of $13.1 billion, which jumped 47% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 18% to $1.24. Management expects this upward trajectory to continue, increasing its full-year revenue forecast to $51.5 billion, representing growth of 44%.

Any S&P 500 Magnificent Seven stocks would be a welcome addition to any investor's portfolio. Unfortunately for most investors, Magnificent Seven shares are so expensive that they're largely out of reach if you're not already wealthy (or close to it). Thankfully, that isn't the case because of a unique exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows you to own shares in four Magnificent Seven stocks simultaneously.

Don't Miss:

The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF heavily focuses on big tech, which accounts for 61.4% of the 71 stocks in the ETF's portfolio. However, 45% of the ETF's portfolio is invested in Apple (13.36%), Amazon (6.82%), Microsoft (12.35%) and Nvidia (12.52%). Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia are all at the forefront of the AI revolution, while Amazon has become a dominant force in e-commerce.

That's impressive enough, but the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF doesn't stop there. Regarding weight allocation, every S&P 500 Magnificent Seven member is included in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF's top ten. That means you'll also be investing in Meta and Tesla. The fund also holds shares in market share and sector powerhouses like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco and McDonalds.

See Also: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.

All these companies offer products and services in high demand from large segments of the buying public. They also have a level of global recognition that is difficult to overestimate. According to Ycharts, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven is over $16 trillion. Ycharts data also shows that Magnificent Seven heavyweights Google, Nvidia and Microsoft are up by nearly 50% in 2024.

The same data also reveals the Magnificent Seven stocks have been responsible for 64.1% of the S&P 500's market cap growth for the year. So, when you buy into the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, you buy shares in multiple companies that have grown rapidly throughout 2024. They also look set for continued growth in 2025 and beyond."

The iPhone maker is looking to ultimately overtake Qualcomm's technology by 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Qualcomm, a leading designer of modem chips that connect phones to mobile data networks, has warned investors that Apple will eventually stop using its chips.

The chip designer has a deal to keep selling chips to Apple until at least 2026 and investors are keen to see if Qualcomm's push into laptops and AI-powered data centers can accelerate quickly enough to compensate for potential drops in revenue from Apple.

Apple's new component is set to feature in the iPhone SE, the company's entry-level smartphone, which is scheduled for its first update since 2022 next year, the Bloomberg News report said, adding that it will be followed by further generations of increasingly advanced chips.

Qualcomm did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while Apple declined to comment.

The iPhone maker has been working on its own modem technology and spent $1 billion to buy Intel's modem unit in 2019.

In early 2019, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.

Last year, Apple signed a multi-billion-dollar deal with chipmaker Broadcom to develop 5G radio frequency components. Such a deal could hurt companies such as Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo, both of which are Apple suppliers.

He boasts a track record dating back nearly 70 years in which he has produced eye-popping returns for those willing to stick with him over the long run.

Buffett has overseen the growth of Berkshire's investable assets, reaching well over $600 billion today. But Buffett hasn't seen a lot to like in the stock market recently. In fact, he's made some big sales of two of Berkshire's largest stock holdings in recent quarters, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). At the same time, he's piled most of the money from those stock sales and Berkshire's ongoing operating income into one high-yield investment.

Here's what investors need to know.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

$133 billion of sales in 2024 (so far)

Buffett (through Berkshire) sold off $133 billion worth of stock through the first nine months of 2024.

The bulk of that was Apple stock. Berkshire held 905.6 million shares of Apple at the start of the year. The stock made up nearly half of the entire equity portfolio Buffett and his team managed. But Buffett has significantly cut down on that position so far this year.

He sold 116 million shares in the first quarter, 389 million shares in the second quarter, and 100 million shares in the third quarter. The entire stake stands at 300 million shares today. That said, those shares are worth about $70 billion, as of this writing, accounting for over 23% of Berkshire's entire equity portfolio. That means Apple is still Berkshire's largest equity position. Buffett said it's extremely likely Apple will be the largest common stock holding in Berkshire's portfolio at the end of the year during Berkshire's shareholder meeting in May.

There's a chance Buffett will continue selling off Berkshire's stake in Apple during the fourth quarter, though. Shares hit a new all-time high in October, and continue to trade around that level as of this writing.

Buffett has also turned his attention to Berkshire's stake in Bank of America recently. Between July and October, Berkshire sold at least $10.5 billion worth of shares in the bank stock. Berkshire's stake in the company fell below 10% as a result of the sales, so investors will have to wait until Berkshire's next earnings report and 13F filing to see if Buffett continued to trim the position. Considering the stock currently trades at a price higher than every previous sale from Berkshire, there's a good chance Buffett continued selling.

It rose above several oil giants to the top spot in 2011 and hasn't dropped out of the Top 3 since then. Apple isn't always the top dog, occasionally passed by fellow tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for a while, but it never strays far from the top spot. And it's back on the throne as of this writing with a $3.54 trillion market cap on November 25.

I'm not saying that the iPhone will go out of style and send Apple's stock tumbling down the rankings over the next decade. However, I could definitely imagine a couple of currently smaller names becoming more valuable than Cupertino's finest in 10 years or so. Read on to see why I expect Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to wrest away Apple's market cap crown over time.

Why Apple might lose its market crown

First of all, I have to assume that Apple's record-setting stock gains will slow down in the coming years. Otherwise, Amazon and Alphabet would have a hard time catching up. They are starting several steps behind the current leader, after all:

Tech Giant Market Cap 5-year Market Cap Change Apple $3.54 trillion 203% Amazon $2.10 trillion 145% Alphabet $2.03 trillion 130%

Data found on YCharts and Finviz, 11/25/24.

Apple didn't find its leading market position in a cereal box. Despite faltering sales of iPhones and iPads, the company maintained a solid foundation of hardware sales paired with soaring software and service revenues in recent years. This trio has stayed fairly close since 2020, but Apple always seems to find a way back up.

My mildly bearish thesis is that Apple is running out of truly innovative ideas. I know, you've heard it all before -- iPads are just larger iPhones without a phone service, the lucrative Apple ecosystem is bad for the customer, high prices don't always reflect superior products, and so on. Apple bears have been saying this stuff for years, but guess who's still the most valuable company in the world?

Still, Apple has seen more misses than home runs lately. The Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset never found a market and is reportedly being discontinued after less than a year. The latest round of product introductions essentially featured slightly faster iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads with more memory. Only time will tell whether the highly touted Apple Intelligence set of artificial intelligence (AI) features will make a difference. Either way, Apple didn't lead the charge into the generative AI era.

Then he forgot about it for more than two years.

In 2014, when Gronkowski was playing for the New England Patriots, he was having a 4,486-square-foot house built in Foxborough, Mass., about 20 miles outside Boston. The contractor Gronkowski hired gave the tight end, who was then 25 years old, some valuable investment advice.

“Every time I saw him, when we were building the house, he kept saying, ‘Get Apple. Get Apple,’” Gronkowski tells Fortune in an exclusive interview alongside Julian Edelman, his former Patriots teammate and current cohost on the Dudes on Dudes podcast. “So after the 50th time, I got it. And let me tell you, it's the best investment I've ever had in my life.”

At the time Gronkowski, or Gronk as he’s known in the football world, was just four years into his playing career. While making millions from his NFL contracts and endorsement deals, he was a novice in financial matters.

“I [had] never been involved in stocks,” Gronkowski says. “I really didn’t know how stocks work. So I was like, ‘All right, let me do this, man.’”

After the advice from the helpful homebuilder, Gronkowski decided to “go big.” The amount he invested was in keeping with his persona of a lovable jock.

“Obviously this just fits along the lines of just me being myself; I'm going to put $69,000 into Apple stock,” Gronkowski says. “So I call up my financial advisor. I’m like, ‘Put $69,000 in Apple.’ My own money, with no advice like this, is just from the guy who built my house here in the New England area.”

Gronkowski actually ended up forgetting he’d even invested the money until about two and a half years later, he says. By the time he remembered he'd squirreled away the money, his $69,000 investment had more than tripled to $250,000. He promptly sold a portion of his Apple stock and kept the rest.

“Now to this day, I have over $600,000 in Apple stock, all because of the investment I made in 2014 having no idea what I was doing, but just listening to the guy that built my house here in New England,” Gronkowski says.

Circa 2014, the year of Gronkowski’s investment, was a marquee year for Apple. The tech giant started the year with a horrendous first quarter that had investors fretting the company had lost its mojo after the death of iconic founder Steve Jobs. The next quarter, the stock clobbered analyst expectations, soared 8% in a day, and continued the climb to becoming the most valuable company in the world. (Earlier this month, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company.)

Englander either added to or reduced Millennium's positions in many of its holdings in the third quarter of 2024. Some of his most notable trades involved buying and selling ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.

Not so magnificent?

Buffett trimmed Berkshire's position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) by 25% in Q3. Englander made an even more emphatic move, slashing Millennium's stake in the iPhone maker by a whopping 90.4%. However, the hedge fund didn't completely exit its position with Apple. It still owns 1.22 million shares worth around $285 million at the end of Q3.

Englander hasn't explained publicly his rationale for selling most of his shares of Apple. Perhaps he decided to ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" with the company's launch of its new generative AI functionality. Notably, though, his hedge fund increased the number of call and put options that it owns for Apple.

Millennium drastically reduced its position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 as well. It sold 86.9% of its stake in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. This was perhaps a surprising move considering Amazon's marked improvement in profitability and free cash flow in recent quarters.

Englander didn't take the axe as heavily to Millennium's stake in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). He sold 1.6 million shares of the chipmaker, reducing his fund's position by roughly 12.6%. Nvidia still ranked as his fourth-largest holding at the end of Q3, though.

Why sell Nvidia? My hunch is that Englander was simply taking some profits off the table. However, he perhaps could have been concerned about the reported delays in Nvidia's shipments of new GPUs based on its powerful Blackwell architecture.

Buying mode

Englander loaded up on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) during Q3. He bought 1.56 million additional shares of the tech giant, boosting Millennium's stake by 51.4%. Microsoft ranked as the hedge fund's third-largest holding at the end of the quarter.

He also added modestly to Millennium's position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) in Q3. The hedge fund owned 1.34 million shares at the end of the quarter, up 7.6% from three months earlier.

In a security advisory on its website, Apple said it was aware of two vulnerabilities that ""may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems."" The bugs are considered ""zero day"" vulnerabilities because they were unknown to Apple at the time they were exploited.

To fix the bugs, Apple released a software update for macOS Sequoia, bumping the software version to 15.1.1, as well as releasing iOS 18.1.1 that has fixes for iPhones and iPads. Users running the older iOS 17 software also get updates.

It's not yet known who is behind the attacks targeting Mac users, or how many Mac users have been targeted — or if any were successfully compromised. The vulnerabilities were reported by security researchers at Google's Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed hacking and cyberattacks, suggesting that a government actor may be involved in the attacks. Government-backed cyberattacks sometimes involve the use of commercial phone spyware.

As for the bugs themselves, Apple said the vulnerabilities relate to WebKit and JavaScriptCore, the web engines that power the Safari browser and for running web content. WebKit is a frequent target of malicious hackers, who target the engine for vulnerabilities as a way to break into the device's wider software and tap into the user’s private data.

The security advisory says the bugs can be exploited by tricking vulnerable Apple devices into processing maliciously crafted web content, such as a website or email, to trigger arbitrary code execution, which can allow the planting of malware on a target's device.

Users should update their iPhones, iPads, and Macs as soon as possible.

Buffett's ability to consistently outperform Wall Street's major indexes over lengthy timelines has some investors eager to ride his coattails. Thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this can be done with relative ease.

A 13F is a required filing by institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides investors with a snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Nov. 14 was the filing deadline to disclose trading activity for the September-ended quarter.

Consistent with Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs over the last two years, Buffett and his team have been net sellers of equities and very selective buyers. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, one top holding continues to get the heave-ho, while another beloved consumer goods brand is suddenly a popular buy.

Shares of Berkshire's top holding continue to be shown to the door

Based on Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated cash flow statements, Buffett and his team have sold more stocks than they've purchased for eight consecutive quarters (dating back to Oct. 1, 2022), totaling an aggregate of $166.2 billion. No stock accounts for a greater percentage of this $166.2 billion than top consumer brand Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30, Berkshire Hathaway has sold 615,560,382 shares of Apple, which reduced its stake in Wall Street's second-largest company by a staggering 67%. Keep in mind that even after dumping 615.56 million shares of Apple, it's still Berkshire's largest holding by almost $25 billion in market value.

During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, Buffett opined during the question-and-answer session with investors that the corporate income tax rate would likely head higher. He thus intimated that selling Apple's stock was a way for Berkshire to lock in sizable unrealized gains at a favorable tax rate.

However, with Donald Trump winning the presidency and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, corporate income tax increases look to be firmly off the table for at least the next four years. Considering that Apple's stock has risen significantly on its artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations as Buffett has sold, it's fair to say that Berkshire Hathaway has missed out on a pretty penny in gains.

Last week, 404 Media reported that law enforcement officers and forensic experts were concerned that some iPhones were rebooting themselves under mysterious circumstances, which made it harder for them to get access to the devices and extract data. Citing security researchers, 404 Media later reported that iOS 18 had a new “inactivity reboot” feature that forced the devices to restart.

Now we know exactly how long it takes for this feature to kick in.

On Wednesday, Jiska Classen, a researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute and one of the first security experts to spot this new feature, published a video demonstrating the ""inactivity reboot"" feature. The video shows that an iPhone left alone without being unlocked reboots itself after 72 hours.

Magnet Forensics, a company that provides digital forensic products including the iPhone and Android data extraction tool Graykey, also confirmed that the timer for the feature is 72 hours.

“Inactivity reboot"" effectively puts iPhones in a more secure state by locking the user's encryption keys in the iPhone's secure enclave chip.

“Even if thieves leave your iPhone powered on for a long time, they won't be able to unlock it with cheaper, outdated forensic tooling,” Classen wrote on X. “While inactivity reboot makes it more challenging for law enforcement to get data from devices of criminals, this won't lock them out completely. Three days is still plenty of time when coordinating steps with professional analysts.”

The product, code-named J490, could be announced as early as March, the report said, adding that it will spotlight the new AI platform, Apple Intelligence.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The higher-end device could be priced as much as $1,000 depending upon the components being used, the report said, but the display-only device would be far less than that.

The potential device launch would come as the tech behemoth looks to compete with rivals in the smart home market, including Google's Nest Hub and Amazon's Echo Show and Echo Hub smart displays.

The AI wall tablet, which looks like a square iPad and is about the size of two iPhones side by side, has a roughly 6-inch screen and will be offered in silver and black colors, Bloomberg News said.

The product will be a standalone device, but it will require an iPhone for some tasks, the report said.

That’s exactly the kind of rumor you don’t want to drop in the week between the announcement and launch of a new MacBook Pro. A deeper dive reveals that the planned revamp is coming at some point in 2026.

It’s still very much a rumor/early report, meaning that it might not happen in that timeframe — if, indeed, it happens at all. A lot can change in 1.5 years, especially in this world of consumer electronics. But not all that much has changed since Apple’s premium laptop was released this time last year.

In fact, MacBook Pro releases are now more or less like clockwork. It’s an annual ritual built around the arrival of a new chipset, not unlike the iPhone release schedule. There’s no guarantee that Apple will continue the current release cadence for the M-series of chips, but it seems to be working well for the company so far.

Apple has its work cut out for itself, if it plans to deliver an iPhone and MacBook that are “the thinnest and lightest in their categories across the whole tech industry,” as the report states. The M-series delivered a much-needed shot in the arm to the line, making the last few generations of MacBook not only the most powerful, but the all-around best the company has delivered.

Efficiencies delivered via Apple Silicon are at the heart of the new Mac Mini overall, allowing the company to significantly shrink down the desktop’s size. The question isn’t whether the M series will result in a literal thinning of the line; that much seems obvious. What is less clear, however, is whether sacrifices will be required.

For one thing, the Pro line’s processing power have thus far required Apple to include a fan — something now absent from the Air. For another, battery life is now a hallmark feature. I’m old enough to remember when liveblogging an event required me to haul an external battery around. These days, I don’t even have to think about plugging my MacBook Air in on a cross-country flight — which is great, because Delta’s seat-back power outlets are and have always been a disaster.

Apple rates the new Pros at 24 hours on a charge. If Apple wants to sacrifice a literal full day of battery life at the altar of making the laptop thinner, they’re going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.

The question of whether to buy now or wait for the next upgrade will forever loom over major consumer electronics purchases; that’s just the nature of the annual release cycle. That said, an early rumor about a major upgrade arriving at some point in 2026 shouldn’t move the needle much for those wondering whether to pull the trigger today. This time next year may be a different story.

""Apple Intelligence, debuting with iOS 18.1, brings innovative features that seem to be resonating strongly with users,"" noted Loop analyst Ananda Baruah in a note.

Apple's shares were trading down 0.84% Monday morning, in line with conflicting market responses to the company's changing tech approach.

The Oracle of Omaha and his conglomerate holding company Berkshire started to offload shares of Apple late last year, paring down a major bet on the tech company that it opened in 2016.

Berkshire picked up its selling pace earlier this year and by the end of the second quarter, it had halved its stake in Apple, the Financial Times reported, helping to bring its cash reserve to an all-time-high of $277 billion at the time.

But by the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway smashed its previous cash record by selling another quarter of its stake in the tech company, or 100 million shares, bringing its total shares to 300 million, down from 400 million.

In just over a year, the company has sold more than two-thirds of its stake in Apple. Although the tech company is still its top holding at $69.9 billion worth of shares, at its peak, Apple made up $178 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.

The Apple-selling frenzy comes as Buffett has pared down his equity holdings across the board over the past two years. In the third quarter, Berkshire bought just $1.5 billion worth of stocks, making it a net seller of equities for the eighth consecutive quarter, CNN reported.

Berkshire’s $325.2 billion in cash and short-term treasuries now outweigh the market value of its equities, which stood at $271.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter, according to its most recent earnings report. While some have questioned Berkshire's big stock sales, over the last three years the company has done just fine, with its shares rising 52%, outpacing the S&P 500's 22% increase over the same period.

Part of the reason for the massive equity sale lies in Buffett’s prediction that the capital-gains tax rate will increase over the next several years, possibly to help pay down the federal deficit, which stood at about 122% of the country’s GDP as of 2023.

“I would say with present fiscal policies I think that something has to give and I think that higher taxes are quite likely,” Buffett said during Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in May.

Vice President Kamala Harris has said that if elected president, she would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has vowed to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that produce products in the U.S.

While Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway would retain Apple as its largest investment, he added that he wanted to keep more cash on hand.

AI is transforming Alphabet's core business

At the beginning of 2023, Microsoft shocked the technology industry when it agreed to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Microsoft quickly integrated OpenAI's models into its flagship products, including its Bing search engine, which was a direct attempt to erode the dominance of Google Search.

Despite some initial fear among Alphabet's shareholders, Google Search still has a global market share of 90% in the internet search industry today. Nevertheless, the conglomerate was determined to become a serious competitor in the AI race, and its latest Gemini family of AI models are among the industry's best. Seven of Alphabet's products now have 2 billion monthly users, and Gemini is integrated into all of them to transform the customer experience.

Google Search is one of those products. Alphabet introduced AI Overviews earlier this year, which are AI-generated responses that appear at the top of the regular search results. They include text, images, and links to third-party sources to give users rapid answers to their questions, which makes the traditional internet search experience more competitive with the flood of new AI chatbots hitting the market. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai says Overviews are now rolling out to over 100 countries, and they will reach more than 1 billion users every month.

Google Workspace customers can also integrate Gemini into Docs, Sheets, Gmail, and more for an additional monthly subscription fee. Gemini's ability to generate and summarize text, and instantly answer questions on a range of topics can help users significantly improve their productivity. Alphabet said Workspace delivered strong growth in the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), driven by higher revenue per user -- which can be attributed (at least partially) to customers adding Gemini to their existing plans.

At the time, Cook was vice president of corporate materials at Compaq Computer Corporation, had worked at Intelligent Electronics, and had a 12-year-stint at IBM immediately after college. Despite protestations from those close to him about moving to Apple, Cook felt the move was necessary. ""I thought I had the chance of a lifetime,"" he recently told the Wall Street Journal. ""I didn't want to pass that up."" The risk paid off, he said, and it helped him develop a unique leadership style and ascend to the corner office under Jobs’ tutelage.

Among the key management skills he learned from Jobs was the importance of not being married to past beliefs, a competency that Cook says few leaders possess. Jobs welcomed debates, relished being challenged, and valued those who were willing to admit they were wrong when new evidence emerged.

“You could always change [Jobs’] mind if you had the best idea,” Cook said. “We changed each other’s minds. That's the reason it worked so well.” Often, Jobs played devil's advocate and took a stance he didn’t believe in in order to spark a spirited discussion. He felt this was the best way to learn, Cook said at a Recode conference in 2022.

One of the most extensive and long-lasting debates between Jobs and Cook was over how the first iPhone should be sold in the early 2000s. Jobs wanted a revenue share model, in which Apple would have received part of the monthly revenue of a phone carrier, while Cook preferred a subsidy model where carriers paid a portion of the iPhone cost up front, which the carrier would make back through subscription sales Business Insider reports. The company started with Jobs’ model but inevitably switched to Cook’s once he became CEO in 2011, after which iPhone sales skyrocketed. Apple now sells seven iPhones per second, according to the Journal.

Jobs was a mentor to Cook, and although mainly behind the scenes earlier in his Apple career, Cook played a critical role in turning the tech giant around thanks to his logistics, supply chain, and operations prowess. When Jobs briefly stepped away from the CEO role in 2004 due to health issues, Cook stepped in as interim CEO. When Jobs returned in 2005, Cook was promoted to chief operating officer. He was named interim CEO again in 2009 and permanent CEO in 2011 when Jobs officially stepped down from the corner office some weeks before he died from pancreatic cancer.

Cook said in a 2019 Stanford University commencement speech that he felt ill-prepared to lead the company after Jobs’ death. “I learned the real visceral difference between preparation and readiness. It was the loneliest I ever felt in my life by an order of magnitude,” he admitted. Though he hadn’t yet come to terms with the fact that Jobs would no longer be an available sounding board, Cook said he had to perform at his peak for the sake of the company’s longevity.

Siri is getting new features and updates with the launch of iOS 18.1 thanks to the addition of Apple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI offering.

It’s worth noting that some of Siri’s upcoming major updates, such as an integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT and onscreen awareness, aren't yet available with iOS 18.1.

Here's a look at what the introduction of Apple Intelligence allows you to do with the revamped digital assistant.

Enhanced language understanding

Apple is making it easier for people to communicate with Siri, as the assistant is now equipped to better understand natural language. Even if you stumble on your words when talking to Siri, the assistant will still be able to understand you. You can say, for instance, “Siri, set an alarm for, oh wait no, set a timer for 10 minutes. Actually, make that five.” Siri will understand what you’re asking.

Plus, you can ask Siri follow-up questions without having to repeat context. For example, if you ask Siri where your next family reunion is going to take place, it will respond with a location. You can then follow up by asking, “What will the weather be like there?” without having to mention the name of the location.

Type to Siri

Up until now, you could only communicate with Siri via your voice. With Apple Intelligence, you can now type to Siri when you don’t want to speak out loud. You just need to double tap the button on your iPhone or iPad screen to ask Siri any question.

The option to type to Siri is handy when you’re in a quiet environment and can’t speak out loud. Or, perhaps you're in a loud environment; typing to Siri can ensure your inquiry is understood clearly.

Siri now has product knowledge

Siri now has more information about Apple’s products and services, so if you have a question about your Apple device, you can ask Siri for help. That includes how to use a feature for the first time on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

For instance, you can ask Siri how to schedule a text message to send later. Siri will then give you step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Otherwise you'd have to go into your settings and navigate to a help page if you needed more information about your device.

Coming soon

While the features listed above are launching Monday, Apple has promised the roll out of additional Apple Intelligence-powered features for Siri.

Siri will be able to tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT to answer certain questions. For example, if you need recipe ideas to make a meal using some ingredients from your garden, you will be able to ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT to generate some options for you.

After releasing Apple Intelligence features in developer beta and then public beta over the last few months, the company has released these features through iOS 18.1 to all users. While the initial beta version had restrictions on the region where Apple Intelligence was available, you can use the new AI features from anywhere — apart from EU and China — by setting the language as U.S. English.

Here is how you can start using Apple Intelligence features:

Open the Settings app.

Go to the Apple Intelligence & Siri menu.

Tap on the toggle to enable Apple Intelligence.

It will take a while for your iPhone to download the models related to Apple Intelligence and prepare your system for these features. You will get a notification when your iPhone is ready to use Apple Intelligence features.

At the moment, Apple Intelligence is only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs that run on M1 chips.

That’s a high bar—and possibly a problematic one. That’s because the Apple Intelligence that gets rolled out this week won’t be a finished product but rather a work in progress. All of the Apple Intelligence features the company previewed in June won’t be coming to your iPhone or other devices just yet. So, what features are coming this week? Here’s what you need to know.

Apple Intelligence features on launch day

When Apple Intelligence launches this week, it will include a swath of new AI features baked into the iPhone’s operating system—iOS 18.1 (Apple Intelligence is also coming to supported iPads and Macs this week). These features can be broken down into four main categories, according to the release notes (published by 9to5Mac). They are:

Writing tools: Apple Intelligence will allow you to use AI to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text nearly everywhere you can type words in iOS—emails, messages, documents, and more. The proofreading function includes Grammarly-like features that allow you to choose better words and fix grammatical mistakes; rewriting abilities let you make your text sound more friendly, concise, or professional; and “summarizing” means that Apple Intelligence can read your text and generate a summary of the most salient points.

Photos: The most visually eye-catching feature of the Apple Intelligence launch will be the ability to quickly erase unwanted objects from photos. For example, you can tap on a street sign to delete it from that beautiful city sunset shot you took. Another cool feature is the ability to find photos and videos simply by describing what is in them, such as “black cat near cauldron.”

Siri: The iPhone’s digital assistant is a big beneficiary of the Apple Intelligence launch. Siri gets a revamped look—the borders of your iPhone’s screen glow when Siri is engaged—along with a more natural voice and the ability to understand requests in the context of previous requests.

Notifications: Perhaps the biggest productivity benefit included in the Apple Intelligence launch is the ability for Apple Intelligence to summarize notifications from multiple apps, showing you the most important information you need to act on.

(Reuters) -Apple convinced a federal jury on Friday that early versions of health monitoring tech company Masimo's smartwatches infringe two of its design patents as part of a broader intellectual property dispute between the companies.

The jury, in Delaware, agreed with Apple that previous iterations of Masimo's W1 and Freedom watches and chargers willfully violated Apple's patent rights in smartwatch designs.

But the jury awarded the tech giant, which is worth about $3.5 trillion, just $250 in damages - the statutory minimum for infringement in the United States.

Apple's attorneys told the court the ""ultimate purpose"" of its lawsuit was not money, but to win an injunction against sales of Masimo's smartwatches after an infringement ruling.

On that front, jury also determined that Masimo's current watches did not infringe Apple patents covering inventions that the tech giant had accused Masimo of copying.

Masimo said in a statement it appreciated the jury's verdict ""in favor of Masimo and against Apple on nearly all issues,"" and that the decision only applied to a ""discontinued module and charger.""

""Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo's current products, and the jury's verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,"" Masimo said.

Apple said in a statement that it was ""glad the jury's decision today will protect the innovations we advance on behalf of our customers.""

Irvine, California-based Masimo accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration.

Masimo convinced the U.S. International Trade Commission last year to block imports of Apple's Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after the commission found their technology for reading blood oxygen levels infringed Masimo's patents.

Apple has appealed the decision and resumed selling the watches after removing the technology. The tech giant countersued Masimo for patent infringement in 2022, alleging Masimo copied Apple Watch features to use in its smartwatches.

Apple also accused Masimo of using lawsuits at the ITC and in California to ""make way for Masimo's own watch.""

Masimo said Apple's patent lawsuit was ""retaliatory"" and ""an attempt to avoid the court in which the parties have been litigating their dispute.""

The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.

Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category.

Apple Intelligence (yes, AI for short) isn’t a standalone feature. Rather, it’s about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps.

We learned more during the Apple's iPhone 16 event, which was held on September 9. During the event, Apple touted a number of AI-powered features coming to their devices, from translation on the Apple Watch Series 10, visual search on iPhones and a number of tweaks to Siri's capabilities. The first wave of Apple Intelligence is arriving at the end of October, as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. A second wave of features are available as part of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 developer betas.

The features launched first in U.S. English. Apple has since added Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, and U.K. English localizations.

Support for Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will arrive in 2025. Notably, users in both China and the EU may not get any access to Apple Intelligence features, owing to regulatory hurdles.

What is Apple Intelligence?

Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music.

The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts.

(Reuters) - Nvidia dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company on Friday following a record-setting rally in the stock, powered by insatiable demand for its specialized artificial intelligence chips.

Nvidia's stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion, slightly above Apple's $3.52 trillion, LSEG data showed.

Nvidia was last up 2.2%, with a market value of $3.52 trillion, while Apple's shares rose 0.9%, valuing the iPhone maker at $3.54 trillion.

In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.

Microsoft's market value stood at $3.20 trillion, with its stock up 1.3%.

The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet , Meta Platforms and other heavyweights to dominate the emerging technology.

Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.

Nvidia and other semiconductor stocks got a lift on Friday after data storage maker Western Digital reported quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimates, buoying optimism about data center demand.

""More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia.""

Nvidia's shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI.

Meanwhile, Apple is struggling with tepid demand for its smartphones. iPhone sales in China slipped 0.3% in the third quarter, while sales of phones made by rival Huawei surged 42%.

With Apple set to report its quarterly results on Thursday, analysts on average see its revenue climbing 5.55% year over year to $94.5 billion, LSEG data showed.

That compares with analysts' projections for Nvidia of nearly 82% revenue growth to $32.9 billion.

It's worth noting that Apple sold just 1.4 million iPhones in 2007. For comparison, the popular Nokia 3310 sold 7.4 million units in the fourth quarter of that year alone. The Nokia device was seven years old at that time, and it was simply a feature phone. However, Apple changed the game by infusing the internet, entertainment, and a touchscreen into the same device.

Apple has come a long way since then. It was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, according to IDC. The company shipped 234.6 million iPhones last year and controlled 20.1% of the market. It was slightly ahead of Samsung, which had a 19.4% share of the smartphone space last year. The two companies have long been involved in a fierce duel for smartphone supremacy and are now looking at artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock the next growth frontier in this space.

Samsung has been ahead of Apple in the generative AI smartphone market so far. However, Apple made its AI move in June this year when it introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI features. Let's take a closer look at Apple Intelligence and see why the company could use this feature to boost its growth.

The monetization of Apple Intelligence

Apple says its generative AI platform will unlock ""new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively."" From enabling users to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text to recording, transcribing, and summarizing audio to a more intelligent Siri, there are a bunch of tools that Apple Intelligence users will get access to.

Apple hasn't announced whether it will charge a fee for its generative AI features. However, there is a strong likelihood of the company heading in that direction. That's because Apple isn't just a hardware company. The tech giant has a flourishing services business that has generated $71 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, accounting for nearly a quarter of its top line.

The important thing here is that the services business has a much fatter margin profile than Apple's product business. Apple's services business reported a 74% gross margin in the fiscal third quarter, compared to the product segment's gross margin of 35%. The services business currently has a range of offerings that include cloud storage, music, TV, gaming, fitness, and news.

Apple stock fell 3% after a report said demand for the latest iPhone is waning.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple cut iPhone 16 orders by 10 million units.

Apple's AI features are not yet driving immediate iPhone upgrades, Kuo said.

Apple stock tumbled on Wednesday, outpacing the broader market's declines as a prominent supply chain analyst warned of waning demand for its new iPhone 16 models.

Shares of Apple dropped about 3% compared to the Nasdaq 100's 2% decline in Wednesday afternoon trades. The stock was trading at $229.50 at 2:50 p.m. ET.

The decline in Apple stock accelerated Wednesday morning after closely followed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities said that the company slashed its iPhone 16 orders by about 10 million units.

The reported production cuts cover the fourth-quarter of 2024 and the first half of 2025, according to the report.

Kuo said the iPhone drop in orders suggests there's ""no evidence yet that Apple Intelligence could boost iPhone shipments in the near term.""

Apple Intelligence refers to Apple's artificial intelligence tools, which include on-device AI capabilities that could also be outsourced to the cloud.

While the company released its new iPhone line last month, its first round of software updates to bring Apple Intelligence to users of its devices isn't scheduled until later this month, and some features won't be updated until later this year.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Apple's head of software, Craig Federighi, said the company's AI tools are a long-term story.

""This is a big lift, and we feel like we want to get it right,"" Federighi said.

He added: ""This isn't a one-and-done kind of situation. This is a many year, honestly even decades-long arc of this technology playing out.""

For now, consumers don't seem to be rushing to upgrade their iPhones for the yet-to-be-released AI software features, which include summaries of text and email notifications, enhanced photo editing capabilities, and the ability to rewrite or generate an e-mail or text message response.

According to Kuo, the production cut for the iPhone 16 likely won't be fully reflected in Apple's fourth-quarter revenue results, as the product mix of more expensive iPhone Pro models ""is more favorable.""

""However, iPhone revenues are expected to come under pressure in 1H25 due to a YoY shipment decline and a less favorable product mix due to the launch of the SE4,"" Kuo said.

The iPhone SE4 is Apple's lower-cost iPhone, which is expected to be launched in the first quarter of next year. The phone is expected to cost around $500 and have the processing power required to run Apple Intelligence features.

The accurately dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a mouthwatering aggregate return of more than 5,600,000% since he became CEO almost six decades ago.

Riding Buffett's coattails has been a surefire long-term investment strategy. Mirroring his trades is made simple thanks to required Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the SEC. This filing provides a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's best money managers are buying and selling -- and there's no 13F more anticipated each quarter than Berkshire Hathaway.

Over the last two years, Buffett and his team have been decisive net sellers of stocks. Based on the seven quarters of cash flow statements from Berkshire Hathaway (from Oct. 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024), Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have sold close to $132 billion more in stocks than they've purchased.

While no Warren Buffett stock has been given the heave-ho quite like Berkshire's No. 1 holding, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the Oracle of Omaha is finding value in Wall Street's most prominent reverse stock split stock of 2024.

Buffett has sent over 515 million shares of Apple to the chopping block since October 2023

Amid Warren Buffett's selling spree, top holding Apple has been meaningfully reduced. In a three-quarter period from Oct. 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024, Berkshire's stake in Apple declined by more than 515 million shares, or 56%, to precisely 400 million shares.

Benign profit-taking may very well be the catalyst that enticed Buffett to ring the register. During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, he opined that the corporate tax rate would likely climb in the future. With his company sitting on a mammoth unrealized gain in Apple, he suggested that locking in some gains now at a lower tax rate would, eventually, be viewed favorably by Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

To add to this point, Berkshire's chief has continued to praise Apple's business, even as he sizably pared down his company's No. 1 position. He appreciates Apple's strong branding and the loyalty of its customer base.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.

Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.

Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.

As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

The move was intended to pre-emptively protect the country's small and medium-sized businesses against cheap products being offered by PDD Holdings' Temu, communications minister Budi Arie Setiadi told Reuters, even though authorities have not found any transactions yet by its residents on the platform.

Temu's rapid growth has triggered scrutiny over its low-cost business model of sending parcels to customers from China by several countries.

Temu's business model, which connects consumers directly with factories in China in order to significantly reduce prices, is ""unhealthy competition,"" Budi said.

""We're not here to protect e-commerce, but we protect small and medium enterprises. There are millions we must protect,"" the minister said.

Jakarta will also block any investment by Temu in local e-commerce if it makes such a move, Budi said, adding he has not heard of any such plan.

Budi also said the government plans to request a similar block for Chinese shopping service Shein.

Temu, Shein, Apple and Google did not respond to requests to comment. Temu can still be downloaded in app stores in Indonesia.

Indonesia forced China's ByteDance social media platform TikTok to close its e-commerce service in the country last year to protect local merchants and users' data.

Months later, TikTok agreed to buy a majority stake in Indonesian tech conglomerate GoTo's e-commerce unit in order to stay in Southeast Asia's biggest e-commerce market.

On Tuesday, Indonesian homegrown e-commerce Bukalapak.com denied reports about an acquisition plan by Temu.

Indonesia's e-commerce industry is set to expand to about $160 billion by 2030 from $62 billion in 2023, according to a report by Google, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and consultancy Bain & Co.

On Oct. 5, the anniversary of his passing, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on the journey of this tech visionary who transformed not just how we use computers, but how we live our daily lives.

How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.

The Early Days: A Spark Of Genius

Jobs’ story begins in San Francisco, where he was born in 1955 and later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. From an early age, he showed a keen interest in electronics, tinkering with gadgets in his family’s garage.

As a teenager, Jobs’ rebellious spirit and thirst for knowledge led him to Reed College. Though he dropped out after just one semester, he continued to audit classes that piqued his interest.

One of these was a calligraphy course, which might seem like an odd choice for a future tech mogul. But Jobs later credited this class with influencing Apple’s groundbreaking approach to typography and design.

Most Valuable Company Today Had Humble Beginnings

The story of Apple’s humble beginnings in a garage has become the stuff of Silicon Valley legend.

In 1976, Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer Company. Their first product, the Apple I, was essentially a circuit board that hobbyists could use to build their own computers.

However, the Apple II, released in 1977, really put them on the map.

The Apple II wasn’t just a computer for geeks – it was a machine that regular people could use.

Apple today has a market capitalization of $3.448 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.

Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.

The Macintosh Revolution

Fast forward to 1984, and Apple was ready to change the world again with the Macintosh.

This was the first commercially successful computer to feature a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse.

If you’ve ever used a computer with icons and windows (which, let’s face it, is pretty much every computer nowadays), you can thank Jobs and his team for pushing this revolutionary idea into the mainstream.

But It Was Not Always Smooth Sailing

In 1985, after a power struggle with then-CEO John Sculley, Jobs left Apple, the company he had co-founded. It was a huge blow, but Jobs wasn’t one to sit idle.

He went on to found NeXT, a company that aimed to create high-end computers for the education market. While NeXT didn’t achieve the commercial success Jobs had hoped for, it would later play a crucial role in Apple’s future.

Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.

From Side Project To Animation Powerhouse

During his time away from Apple, Jobs also bought a little computer graphics division from Lucasfilm. This would become Pixar Animation Studios.

Under Jobs’ guidance, Pixar went from a tech company to an animation powerhouse, releasing groundbreaking films like “Toy Story” and forever changing the landscape of animated storytelling.

...And Then The Prodigal Son Returns

By the mid-90s, Apple was struggling. The company that had once been at the forefront of personal computing was floundering, with a confusing product line and declining sales.

In a twist of fate, Apple announced that it was acquiring NeXT in 1996, bringing Jobs back into the fold as an advisor.

He quickly became interim CEO (or “iCEO” as he jokingly called himself) and set about turning the company around.

The Apple Renaissance

Jobs’ return to Apple marked the beginning of one of the greatest comebacks in business history. He streamlined the product line, focusing on simplicity and design.

The result? A string of iconic products that would redefine entire industries:

The iMac (1998): A colorful, all-in-one computer that made technology fun and accessible. The iPod (2001): Not the first MP3 player, but the one that made digital music mainstream. The iPhone (2007): A device that put the internet, a music player, and a phone in your pocket, changing the way we communicate forever. The iPad (2010): Bridging the gap between smartphones and laptops, creating a new category of device.

The Jobs Philosophy

What set Jobs apart wasn’t just his ability to create great products, but his unwavering commitment to certain principles:

Simplicity: Jobs believed that technology should be intuitive and easy to use.

Design: He saw beauty in minimalism and insisted that even the parts users couldn’t see should be well-designed.

Integration: Jobs pushed for seamless integration between hardware and software, creating ecosystems that just worked.

He once said, ""Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful [at Apple], that’s what matters to me.""

The Final Chapter

In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Despite this setback, he continued to lead Apple, overseeing some of the company’s most innovative years.

However, his health struggles eventually led to him stepping down as CEO in Aug. 2011.

On Oct. 5, 2011, he passed away, leaving behind a legacy that had fundamentally changed multiple industries – computing, music, movies, telecommunications, and retail.

The Legacy Lives On

Today, Apple continues to be one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies. While it has evolved under the leadership of Tim Cook, many of Jobs’ core principles still guide the company.

But Jobs’ influence extends far beyond Apple. His vision of technology as a tool to enrich our lives has shaped the entire tech industry. From the smartphones we carry in our pockets to the way we consume media, Jobs’ fingerprints are everywhere.

He once said, “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” He was certainly one of those people, and the world is all the richer for it.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Extensive damage from a fire at Tata Group's Apple iPhone component plant in southern India could hamper production ahead of a festive season sales surge, an industry watcher and a source said, forcing the U.S. firm's suppliers to arrange critical parts from China or elsewhere.

The weekend blaze has caused an indefinite production halt at Tata's Hosur plant in Tamil Nadu, the only Indian supplier of iPhone back panels and some other parts for both contract manufacturer Foxconn in the country and its own iPhone assembly at another plant.

Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research told Reuters it estimates local sales of 1.5 million units of iPhone 14 and 15 models during the Indian festive season which runs from late October to early November, with Apple struggling to fulfil as much as 15% of that demand due to the fire.

""There will be a 10-15% impact on production of older iPhone models from India. Apple could offset that impact by importing more components, and by re-routing more export inventory towards India,"" said Neil Shah, a co-founder of Counterpoint, which has for years tracked Apple's global shipments.

Apart from local sales, Tata, one of India's biggest conglomerates, also exported iPhones to the Netherlands and United States as well as some parts to China, worth more than $250 million overall, in the year to Aug. 31, commercially available customs data shows.

Tata declined to comment.

Apple suppliers typically carry a three- to four-week stock of back panels, Counterpoint said. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter estimated, however, that Apple was likely to have stock for eight weeks, and therefore would not see an immediate impact.

However, they added that if the production suspension continues, the U.S. company could set up another assembly line in China or add shifts there to secure parts for India's iPhone manufacturers.

Supply chain disruptions more generally have cast a shadow over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to attract foreign investors to ""Make in India"", especially in the electronics sector.

Apple has been diversifying beyond China but last year separate fire incidents in India caused suppliers Foxlink and Pegatron to briefly halt operations, with authorities finding much of the fire safety equipment at Foxlink's facility was not functional. Contractors Wistron and Foxconn have also been hit by labour unrest in recent years.

""These are temporary setbacks,"" said Prabhu Ram, vice president at Cybermedia Research. ""Continued efforts to improve safety and operational standards are crucial for strengthening India's position as an emerging global electronics manufacturing hub.""

Story continues

Tata is among Apple's newest suppliers in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total global iPhone shipments this year, up from 12-14% last year.

The fire-hit plant employed 20,000 workers. Another unit in the same Tata complex was due to start making complete iPhones later this year and it is unclear if the incident will cause this to be delayed.

Tata has another iPhone plant near Bengaluru, which it acquired from Wistron last year, and a second one in Tamil Nadu near Chennai, which it is set to acquire from Pegatron.

But pre–sale estimates point to a more muted early response than Apple had hoped.

Apple needed the iPhone 16 to be a big seller after years of sluggish iPhone sales. Long gone are the years when loyal Apple fans would line up to trade in their device on a near-annual basis, and the company hasn’t given consumers a big reason to upgrade since adding 5G connectivity with the iPhone 12. It’s been hoping that a suite of new software features that weave AI throughout would be a hit.

But despite several splashy launch events, it’s not clear if Apple has successfully made the case to consumers just yet.

Apple sold just an estimated 37 million units in the first weekend of iPhone 16 pre-sales, down more than 12% compared to the same period last year, according to a blog post from Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with TF International Securities. In particular, demand for the higher priced iPhone 16 Pro devices were down sharply year-over-year compared with the iPhone 15 launch.

One week after pre-sales began, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pegged pre-sales only slightly higher than Kuo’s estimate at roughly 40 million units. CFRA Research technology analyst Angelo Zino also said the first weekend of preorder sales data pointed to a year-over-year decline.

Perhaps more than the number of devices customers bought during presale season, Apple may need to worry about which phones in the iPhone 16 lineup consumers are opting for, given that the upgrades to the standard devices make them comparable in many ways to the Pro models. Analysts say there appears to have been greater demand for the lower priced iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus devices than the Pro and Pro Max, which could affect the average selling price and overall iPhone sales revenue.

In the first weekend of presales, Apple sold 9.8 million iPhone 16 Pros and 17.1 million iPhone 16 Pro Max devices, down 27% and 16% year-over-year, respectively, according to Kuo. By comparison, sales of the standard iPhone 16 and the Plus were up slightly compared to the iPhone 15.

The issue, Zino said, is that the base iPhone models might simply be too good.

“Given that this is largely a software upgrade cycle, my concern is that there were a greater mix of sales in the lower price iPhone 16 than the higher price devices,” Zino said. “When you look at the standard devices, they got a really great upgrade in terms of their cameras and internal processors.”

Kuo also reported shorter delivery lead times for the iPhone 16 Pro models — 1-2 weeks for the iPhone 16 Pro during first weekend pre-sales — compared to the iPhone 15, which saw customers waiting 3-4 weeks for their devices. He pointed to the fact that the iPhone maker’s highly touted AI “Apple Intelligence” features aren’t even available on the devices yet (they’re set to begin rolling out in beta next month along with iOS 18.1), as well as the company’s ongoing struggle with increased competition in China.

Story continues

“You need to wait for word of mouth to trickle through the consumer base over the next couple of quarters,” before consumers will see the value of the new technology, Zino said.

The pre-sale response may indicate that the promise of integrated AI features alone is not enough to spring Apple from its iPhone rut. There’s only so much that Apple can physically do to improve the iPhone’s camera or adjust its screen size, and software updates that many consumers already feel iffy about are likely a harder sell. And for all but the most devoted Apple fans, analysts say that most customers probably don’t yet deeply understand why the AI features would be worth an upgrade.

To be sure, it is still early days for the iPhone 16, and more have been sold since the devices became available on shelves on September 20.

What’s more, the measurements that analysts use to estimate presales don’t necessarily tell the whole story. Many consider lead time, the delay between when consumers order their devices and when they will be delivered, to be a key indicator of demand. The logic goes: the more people who order iPhones, the longer the wait will be.

Lead times are shorter for the iPhone 16 than they were last year, but that may actually be a positive sign that Apple has improved its supply chain, allowing it to produce more phones, more quickly, according to Canalys Analyst Lex Chiew. CFRA’s Zino added that Apple may have also boosted supply ahead of the launch, given the pressure it faced to drive a large upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16.

Another positive signal: T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert told CNBC after the first week of presales that the carrier had sold more iPhone 16s than it had with the iPhone 15 last year.

Apple won’t share any details on iPhone sales numbers until it reports earnings next month, and even then, the data will only include seven days of presales and 10 days of regular sales. But most analysts still expect the iPhone 16 to prove a winner in the coming months despite a possible slow start, especially heading into the all-important final three months of the year.

“It’s all about a monster holiday quarter and the supercycle begins for iPhone 16 in our view,” Ives told CNN in an email.

The tech giant recently fell out of the talks for the round, set to close next week, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Other firms, such as Microsoft and Nvidia, have also been in talks to participate, the report said, adding that Microsoft was expected to invest about $1 billion after having already poured $13 billion into the company.

OpenAI declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last month, the Journal first reported that Apple was in the talks, as part of OpenAI's new fund-raising effort that could value the ChatGPT maker above $100 billion.

The high valuation is a result of the AI arms race OpenAI sparked with its launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, spurring companies across industries to invest billions in the technology to stay ahead of the competition and capture market share.

Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down why he’s concerned about the iPhone maker in the near term despite expecting the company to be a major benefactor of artificial intelligence (AI).

“We're concerned about the upcoming cycle for a number of reasons,” Chkaiban says. “There are early data points suggesting that iPhone 16 reception is poor. Users are often disappointed. They see limited innovation. He adds that Apple Intelligence being delayed until after the initial launch of the device “doesn't really help.”

Among the other factors contributing to Apple’s near-term headwinds are shortening refresh cycles as “iPhone users hold onto their devices for longer” and increased competition in China. Another concern is a general weakness in consumer demand.

Chkaiban projects Apple will ship 215 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, which is 10% below consensus estimates.

Despite near-term concerns, the analyst says Apple is in a prime position in the AI era. He explains, “The generative AI iPhone revolution indeed won't be hardware-driven. It will happen over multiple cycles. It won't create a near-term product cycle, but it will still revolutionize the user experience over time and I do believe that Apple is very well positioned to capture some value as they control a large ecosystem of high-end devices.”

“Over coming years, I think Apple can do well with generative AI, with Apple intelligence getting rolled out. But it's not going to drive a near-term product cycle. That's what we're concerned about.”

He expects that Apple’s revenue will grow, but this growth will be driven by services rather than device sales. “Bottom line is Apple can probably grow revenues mid to high single digits and earnings between low-to-mid teens. And so yes, over the long run, I think Apple is definitely a good name to own. And if there is indeed a pullback related to weakness in the current cycle, that would probably create a good entry point.”

It's gone through some stunning ups and downs, but if you'd bought shares at the initial public offering (IPO) back in 1980 and held on, you'd have a lot more shares, and a lot of money. Let's see just how much.

Holding for the long term

Apple went public in December 1980 at $22 per share. Like pretty much any stock over a nearly 45-year period, Apple stock has climbed and crashed several times. For example, it lost 21% of its value between 1989 and 1996 -- a long period for an investor to hold on to a stock that's losing. But if you did, you'd have quite a windfall today.

Since that time, Apple has developed an incredible tech platform with a strong moat in its differentiated systems and applications. It has a strong, loyal fan base that only buys Apple products and consistently moves up to new drops and launches. Just this week Apple released its latest software update, iOS18, with a swarm of new upgrades and features. It's also investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive in the tech race.

That's why Apple stock has skyrocketed over time and gone through five stock splits: three 2-for-1 stock splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005; a 7-for-1 split in 2014; and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Each IPO share would have been worth $0.10 split adjusted, and you'd own 224 shares today. At today's prices, that's worth $48,455.

In short, the stock has appreciated more than 2,200 times since its IPO. For further perspective, if you had instead invested $1,000 in the stock at its IPO, your investment would've been worth $2.2 million today, excluding the dividends that were paid to you over the years.

Yet, it's time for investors to forget it. Well, not literally -- just figuratively.

That's because, while billionaires like Warren Buffett have been selling shares of Apple, several other famous billionaires have been stocking up on a different stock: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

Here's what's happening and what it means for investors.

Image source: Getty Images.

Billionaires are buying Amazon

Every three months, large investment managers, hedge funds, and company insiders are required to file 13F forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These forms disclose what stocks are held, thus providing the public with a glimpse behind the curtain to see which stocks prominent billionaires are buying and selling.

Last month, the most recent 13F filings were released, with data from the three months ending on June 30, 2024. And it revealed that several well-known billionaires are adding to their positions in Amazon.

For example, Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund run by billionaire Ray Dalio, purchased more than 1.6 million shares of Amazon. That more than doubled the fund's total holdings of Amazon to some 2.65 million shares, worth roughly $500 million.

What's more, Citadel Advisors, the hedge fund run by billionaire Ken Griffin, increased its holdings of Amazon by around 1.1 million shares. It now controls about 7.7 million shares, valued at almost $1.5 billion.

Why billionaires are buying Amazon

All this buying begs the question: ""Why are billionaires racing to buy up shares of Amazon?""

First off, let's remember that 13F disclosures are not a perfect indication of how billionaires really think. For one thing, they're a snapshot. Funds may have already reduced or sold out of stock positions before their 13Fs are even made public.

Second, funds are only forced to disclose their long positions, not their short positions. Therefore, it's difficult to know a fund manager's true intentions. Are they really bullish on a given stock, or is their big new position just a hedge? There's no way to know for sure.

However, assuming that the Amazon positions are bullish bets, what are the reasons for being bullish on Amazon right now?

I can think of more than a few. But let's focus on the company's impressive growth.

Despite already generating well over $500 billion in annual sales, Amazon continues to increase its sales at a breakneck pace. In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on June 30, 2024), the company reported revenue growth of 10%.

Story continues

At that pace, the company may add close to $50 billion to its sales total over the next 12 months. For context, that's the same amount of annual sales generated by Nike, a titan within the sports apparel industry and an iconic American company for more than four decades. In other words, Amazon's revenue is so big and growing so fast, that its growth alone is equivalent to adding a company like Nike -- every year.

Is Amazon still a buy now?

Amazon remains a wonderful company. It has both the world's largest e-commerce business and the largest cloud-services business (Amazon Web Services). Furthermore, it continues to innovate in new and exciting fields, like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).

To sum up, it can be hard to really understand what billionaires are thinking (despite what their 13F filings reveal). Nevertheless, Amazon stock remains a buy now thanks to its excellent fundamentals and solid prospects for the future.

But a pair of health features the company unveiled point to Apple’s continued push into the healthcare space and may prove just as important to keeping users around as its AI efforts.

The capabilities, sleep apnea detection for the Apple Watch and a hearing aid function for the AirPods Pro 2, aren’t yet ready for consumers — they still need approval from global health authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — but Apple expects them to be available in the coming weeks.

The tech giant’s deeper moves into health tracking are just the latest in its quest to become a major player in the industry. As far back as 2019, CEO Tim Cook said Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind will be in health.

So it makes sense that the company would add features to some of its most popular products, the AirPods Pro 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2, that address well-known health problems. Apple says that an estimated 1 billion people around the world have sleep apnea, a disorder that causes breathing disruptions while sleeping and can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease, but the majority of those individuals don’t know they have it. In its own study, Apple said that 75% of people diagnosed with hearing loss aren’t getting the necessary support they need for it.

Apple is quick to point out that sleep apnea detection isn’t meant to diagnose the condition, but is to be used as a guide to alert you to potential sleep problems that you can bring to your doctor to discuss further testing. The Apple Watch tracks your sleep by detecting micro-movements via its built-in accelerometer.

Apple says it submitted the largest ever study on sleep apnea technology to the FDA to validate the watch’s detection capabilities. During its testing of 1,500 people, the company says its sleep apnea detection didn’t alert on a single person that didn’t at least show signs of mild sleep apnea and that it hit on about two-thirds of true sleep apnea cases.

Sleep apnea detection requires users to wear their watches for at least 10 nights over a 30-day period. The more you wear it during that time, the better. Apple will display results in a new breathing disturbances tab in the Health app, showing if you’re dealing with any breathing disruptions throughout the night.

If you’ve experienced enough sleep disturbances, the Health app will alert you that you’re showing signs of sleep apnea. Your breathing can change for any number of reasons from night to night, whether that’s due to a cold or drinking alcohol. Requiring users to wear their watches for 10 nights should help account for those outlier situations.

Story continues

I’ve got sleep apnea and sleep with a CPAP mask every night. But I spent years experiencing awful sleep problems without knowing what the problem was. It took both my former editor and my wife to convince me to go take a sleep test and find out I had an issue. Having the Apple Watch’s alerts would have saved me a lot of time wondering whether I should go to the doctor or not.

Apple’s hearing protection and aid feature for the AirPods Pro 2 is similarly impressive. The option will be available via a software update and include the ability to take a five-minute test to determine if you have a form of hearing loss.

I tried a brief sample of the test: It lasted less than a minute, during which I had to tap the screen each time I heard a beep in my left ear and then my right. It was kind of like the hearing tests you took in school.

I didn’t get to test the hearing aid feature itself, but Apple is positioning it as a replacement for over-the-counter hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Users with severe hearing problems will still need purpose-built hearing aids.

Still, offering a hearing test and over-the-counter-equivalent hearing aid option to consumers could prove to be incredibly helpful to people around the world who otherwise might not realize they even have hearing problems.

Apple’s features also act as another way for the company to both draw new users and keep its existing customers from leaving for competing offerings from Samsung and Google, even if Samsung already offers sleep apnea detection in its own smartwatch.

The idea is for Apple to prove that its products are invaluable devices that you shouldn’t be without. And with its latest offerings, it seems to do just that. We’ll see how consumers react when Apple releases updates for sleep apnea detection and hearing protection and aids in the weeks ahead.

Apple unveiled its long-awaited, AI-boosted iPhone 16 on Monday, hoping the new features would drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in its smartphone sales, which account for more than half of its total sales.

But Apple has yet to announce an AI partner in China to power the 16s, and Apple Intelligence, the company's AI software, will be available in Chinese language only next year.

The iPhone 16 launch dominated discussions on Chinese social media on Tuesday, ahead of Huawei's unveiling of a three-way foldable smartphone later in the day.

On Weibo, China's X-like platform, three of the top 10 trending topics were related to the iPhone 16 launch, with AI features among a key topic of discussion.

The hashtag ""iPhone 16 Chinese version doesn't support AI yet"" attracted 11.33 million views and over 1,500 comments on Weibo.

""What's the point of buying it if you can't use AI?"" wrote one Weibo user.

Another commented, ""Without AI as the biggest selling point, it should be half price.""

The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will cost the same as models they replace. In China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, as government restrictions on the use of foreign-branded phones and increased domestic competition weighed on its smartphone sales.

Other users on Weibo compared Apple's launch with Huawei's new phone, due to be released as the Chinese firm seeks to widen its lead over Apple in its home market.

""Whether iPhone 16 has AI or not doesn't affect me, because I'm going to buy Huawei's tri-fold phone,"" one Weibo user wrote, underscoring the growing popularity of Huawei's latest models in China that helped it replace Apple as the country's No.3 smartphone vendor in the second quarter.

But some analysts predicted the absence of AI features in the iPhone 16 was unlikely to have a big impact on near term sales.

""Chinese consumers are not yet driven to upgrade by AI capabilities ... However, in the long run, as domestic brands use AI as a key differentiator for their flagship products, it will negatively affect Apple,"" said Toby Zhu, an analyst at technology market research firm Canalys.

Zhu said Apple needs to localise its offerings and swiftly establish an AI application and service ecosystem in China to remain competitive.

Story continues

Apple's powerful operating system remains a draw for Chinese consumers, according to Will Wong, an analyst at IDC.

""The key competitive advantage of Apple is its strong customer stickiness. Thus, the replacement needs of the users of the iPhone 11, 12, or 13 series could still support the sales of Apple in the absence of AI.""

""It's still too early to say who will win,"" Wong said.

Pre-orders for the new iPhone start on Friday in China through online retailers such as JD.com, with deliveries beginning on Sept. 20.

The four new smartphones will go on sale on September 20 and come with Apple Intelligence built in, a set of tools which use generative AI to help users with every day administrative tasks as well as offer text and image editing capabilities – following similar tools already launched by rivals Google and Samsung on their flagship phones.

The design changes to the handsets themselves are incremental, but Apple has added a new Camera Control button to the phones, from which users will be able to instantly launch the camera app, take photos and videos or select different capturing tools and options.

The button can also be used to access another new AI-powered tool, called Visual Intelligence, which enables users to carry out image-based searches on places or objects by capturing an photo of them.

Speaking at the event to unveil the new devices, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said these were the first iPhones to be designed “from the ground up for Apple Intelligence” and that the new “personal intelligence system” would have a “profound impact” for users.

“The innovation and invention these products deliver will continue to deepen the meaningful impact they have on all of our lives,” Mr Cook said.

“I’m proud of our teams and what they’ve accomplished and I can’t wait for you to experience these amazing products.”

The AI-powered tools use “personal context” to provide help, Apple said, for example offering edits to writing or notes made in almost any app, or being able to quickly find a specific photo or moment within a video based on a typed description.

The tools can also be used to find specific emails, flight details and other personal information instantly, as well as offer email summaries and prioritise certain notifications and enable users to create their own emoji or new image.

Apple Intelligence can help users rewrite any notes or emails in a range of styles. (Apple)

The tech giant confirmed the new devices would go on sale on September 20, with Apple Intelligence tools rolling out in a software update later.

Ben Wood, smartphone expert and chief analyst at CCS Insight, said although Apple had not entirely shaken the perception that its phone launches were becoming more low-key, its new AI tools were still eye-catching.

“There is a growing feeling that smartphone updates have become a bit boring. Apple is not immune to this trend and is betting on software and AI to breathe new life into its most important product to reignite consumer interest and drive upgrade purchases,” he said.

“As expected, Apple Intelligence features will roll out progressively over the next few months and years. However, at present, a notable exclusion is the EU, where Apple is in a stand-off over compliance with the Digital Markets Act.

“We will be watching closely to see how European consumers react to missing out on the new Apple Intelligence features and whether it affects demand for the iPhone 16.

“We note with interest that Apple Intelligence will be available in the UK — which, since Brexit, falls outside the EU. Historically Apple has treated the region with a consistent approach since the UK’s departure from the trade bloc so this is a notable change.

“Many of the features being offered by Apple Intelligence, such as summarising emails and editing photos, are similar to those previously showcased by Google and Samsung.

“However, as it has done in the past, Apple put a heavy focus on privacy as a differentiator — this aligns well with CCS Insight’s research, which indicates that despite the enthusiasm for AI, about 43% of UK consumers surveyed expressed concerns about privacy and data security.”

Fellow smartphone expert Ernest Doku, from Uswitch.com, agreed that the AI tools were the main notable change in an otherwise incremental iPhone update.

“Last year’s iPhone launch left some a little disappointed by Apple’s strategy of ‘evolution not revolution’, and many feel that Android devices have pulled ahead in the last 12 months,” he said.

“Apple’s latest launch may not have entirely changed this perception, but there are still some innovative features worth calling out on its new flagship smartphone. Although the new camera updates and Camera Control button are impressive, the biggest development is the new handsets’ Apple Intelligence compatibility.

“This unique delivery of deep AI integration into every aspect of the phone ensures Apple’s refresh can keep pace with key features touted at recent releases of Google’s Pixel and Samsung’s Galaxy devices alike.

“An exciting development is Apple’s focus on personal data security when it comes to using generative AI, with nothing shared with Apple while using Apple Intelligence. This could set its AI technology apart, as consumers continue to prioritise their digital privacy.”

Elsewhere, the technology giant unveiled the redesigned and update Apple Watch Series 10, which will include the ability to detect sleep apnea for the first time.

In addition, a software update to the firm’s existing AirPods Pro 2 will enable wearers to use them as a clinical-grade hearing aid."

Here are some products tech behemoth Apple launched at the event:

NEW IPHONE LINEUP

The iPhone 16, starting at $799, comes in two sizes -- 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. The phones are powered by the new A18 chips, which feature a 16-core neural engine designed for generative AI-linked tasks and Apple Intelligence.

The phones also come with a customizable action button, allowing users to perform a variety of functions such as recording voice memo, identifying songs, and translating phrases.

APPLE WATCH UPGRADES

Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 10 starting at $399, which the company claims is its thinnest and fastest charging watch ever.

The Series 10 will be powered by Apple's new S10 chip, which includes a four-core neural engine that will allow machine learning activities and power features such as double tapping on device, Siri dictation, along with crash and fall detection.

Apple also highlighted the health-linked features of its watch, such as sleep apnea detection. The watch will monitor a new metric during sleep called breathing disturbances and will notify users if they display signs of sleep apnea.

AIRPOD MODELS

Apple's AirPods 4, powered by a new custom H2 chip, start at $129 and come with improved audio quality and personalized spatial audio.

Users can also interact with Siri while using the AirPods by nodding ""yes"" or shaking their head to say ""no"" in response to Siri announcements. The charging case has USB-C ports.

The company also said that its AirPods Pro 2 can now be ""transformed"" into a personalized hearing aid via an upcoming software update, boosting the specific sounds in real time, like parts of speech or elements within a user's environment.

Cherney and Kenrick Cai

CUPERTINO, California (Reuters) -Apple on Monday unveiled its artificial intelligence-boosted iPhone 16, showing off the long-awaited phone hours after Chinese rival Huawei's tri-fold phone began racking up orders.

""The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up. It marks the beginning of an exciting new era,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said at a product launch.

The iPhone 16 will use the new A18 chip and have an aluminum back, as well as a new customizable button that can be used for camera controls.

Huawei's website showed on Monday that it had garnered more than 3 million pre-orders for its Z-shaped tri-fold phone. This underscores Huawei's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them.

Apple shares were down less than 1% in afternoon trading.

Apple also unveiled new Watches and AirPods.

The new Series 10 Watch starts at $399, is thinner than its predecessor and has an up to 30% larger screen than previous generations. Apple highlighted the Watch's ability to help with sports and health issues, including finding longer-term conditions such as sleep apnea as well as detecting and responding to emergencies such as a fall.

Apple also launched a new version of the more rugged Watch Ultra 2, starting at $799. The new AirPods 4 have a new design for more comfortable wearing and improved acoustics. And Apple rolled out hearing-aid features that it has submitted for U.S. regulatory review.

Apple fans globally have been waiting to see the new phones with AI, which Cook hinted at as he began the show. “We are thrilled to introduce the first iPhones designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities,” Cook said in opening remarks.

""The Chinese market is hungrier for AI features than the U.S. market,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. For Apple, ""it will be very difficult to bring it to China immediately, so they'll be going off the merits of the hardware.""

Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.

But these upgrades will take time to reach consumers.

Apple Intelligence features are expected to launch in a software update to the iPhone and iPad operating system likely in October and a full upgrade of Apple's voice assistant Siri is likely to come only early next year, according to media reports.

Story continues

Apple Intelligence must be approved by Beijing in order to be released in the Chinese market. In July, OpenAI blocked access to ChatGPT in China, a move that could impact the chatbot's integration into Siri. Apple has not announced an AI partner for China.

IPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's $383 billion sales last year, and the new devices are an important update for the Cupertino, California-based company that is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in iPhone sales.

In China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, prompted by government restrictions and increased domestic competition.

The iPhone 16 lineup is the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features, though those are expected also to be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices.

""The software side, and how Apple frames it, is the biggest question,"" said Bajarin. ""Investors will look for if it's compelling enough to have a larger-than-normal upgrade cycle.""

Rivals including Alphabet's Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apple's dominance in the high-end smartphone market.

Google, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apple's iOS, traditionally announced its Pixel smartphones in the autumn. This year, it pushed the event to August ahead of Apple's announcement.

Google focused on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola.

""The question is who is going to be the first to combine a truly personal AI assistant with knowledge and information that is accurate and personalized,"" said Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst for TECHnalysis Research.

Apple has so far shared a timeline for the release of Apple Intelligence only in the United States, where it is slated to launch on compatible devices in the autumn.

In June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would delay the release in Europe due to European Union tech rules.

Apple's event at the tech giant's Apple Park headquarters started at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 GMT). Huawei has scheduled an official announcement of its Mate XT phone on Tuesday in China.

The new era will dawn Monday with the unveiling of the hotly anticipated iPhone 16 in a Cupertino, California, auditorium named after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who pulled out the first iPhone in 2007 and waved it like a magic wand while predicting it would reshape society.

Apple has sold billions of iPhones since then, helping to create about $3 trillion in shareholder wealth. But in the past decade, there have been mostly minor upgrades from one model to the next — a factor that has caused people to hold off on buying a new iPhone and led to a recent slump in sales of Apple's marquee product.

The iPhone 16 is generating a bigger buzz because it is the first model to be tailored specifically for AI, a technology that is expected to trigger the biggest revolution in the industry since Jobs thrust Apple into the smartphone market 17 years ago.

The advances included in the iPhone 16 could set up Apple to be “the gatekeeper of the consumer AI revolution,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.

Apple's pivot began three months ago with a preview of its new approach during a developers conference, helping to build anticipation for Monday's showcase.

Since that June conference, competitors such as Samsung and Google have made even more strides in AI. Google even took the unusual step of introducing its latest Pixel phones packed with their own AI magic last month instead of hewing to its traditional October timetable in an effort to upstage Apple's release of the iPhone 16.

In an attempt to set itself apart from the early leaders in AI, the technology being baked into the iPhone 16 is being promoted as “Apple Intelligence.” Even so, Apple Intelligence is similar to the generically named AI already available on Google's Pixel 9 and the Samsung Galaxy S24 released in January.

Most of Apple's AI tasks will be performed on the iPhone itself instead of remote data centers — a distinction that requires a special processor within the forthcoming models and the high-end iPhone 15s that came out a year ago.

That's why investors anticipate hot demand for the iPhone 16, spurring a surge in sales that has caused Apple's stock price to climb by 13% since Apple previewed its AI strategy in June. That spike has increased the company's market value by nearly $400 billion."

To provide insights into what consumers can expect, CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco joins Asking for a Trend to discuss.

Eadicicco notes that investors are primarily focused on the likely iPhone 16 product line-up, which is expected to be the ""star of the show."" However, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple is also set to unveil three new Apple Watch models and updated AirPods.

""I think the big question on everybody's mind is gonna be how does Apple Intelligence play into all of this,"" Eadicicco states. She points out that some anticipated features include AI-powered text rewriting and email summarization, as well as an enhanced version of Siri tailored to individual users.

Regarding Apple's AI integration, Eadicicco told Yahoo Finance, ""I think Apple's approach, based on what we've seen, is more contextual, it's more about kind of connecting the dots between the different apps on your phone and kind of using Siri as a way to do that."" However, she cautions that these new AI features may not necessarily drive a widespread upgrade cycle among consumers.

The leadership change comes ahead of Apple's multiple product launch this fall season, which analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone.

It includes artificial intelligence features, which are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a slowdown in global sales, particularly in China, and better compete with rivals who have rolled out AI upgrades.

Parekh, who has been with Apple for more than a decade and will join the company's executive committee, most recently served as vice president of financial planning and analysis.

""It appears that the transition to the new CFO is planned and orderly, which is the most important question. Maestri staying on with Apple is also very important, as it removes the risk of financial questions,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.

""(Parekh) will need to continue the prudent capital management, but may also be tasked with restarting Apple's exploration of complimentary acquisitions.""

Before Apple, Parekh held senior leadership roles at Thomson Reuters and General Motors.

Apple said Maestri will continue to lead the corporate services teams, including information systems and technology, information security and real estate and development, reporting to CEO Tim Cook.

During Maestri's tenure, Apple more than doubled its revenue, with services revenue growing more than five times.

""Apple filling the role with an internal candidate should make the transition a bit smoother... any change of this magnitude does create some level of uncertainty, especially given the consistency and the history of execution from Maestri,"" Piper Sandler analysts said in a note.

Earlier this month, Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed.

In recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.

At its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella ""Apple Intelligence"", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.

The iPhone maker's shares were last down nearly 1% in extended trading.

At its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella ""Apple Intelligence"", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.

However, these features will be available only on the latest Apple devices and will be rolled out gradually starting later this year.

Apple faces increasing pressure from competitors such as Samsung and Alphabet's Google, who have recently announced AI functionality alongside their new Galaxy and Pixel smartphones, respectively.

While Apple's event invite teases ""It's Glowtime,"" no further details have been provided. The company typically announces new iPhones and watches at the fall event, its biggest product showcase every year.

In recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.

Apple has said its third-quarter sales were better than expected on the back of iPhone 15, its latest series, which is set to receive the new AI features. Overall sales in China dropped more than expected at 6.5%, pressured by Chinese smartphone brands, chiefly Huawei.

Want proof? Take a close look at the table below:

Company 2014 Market Cap (in billions) 2024 Market Cap (in billions) IBM $182 $178 Nvidia $10 $2,965

In August 2014, IBM's market cap was roughly 18 times larger than Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA). But oh, how the tables have turned. Today, Nvidia boasts a market cap of about $3 trillion -- roughly 17 times larger than IBM.

So, looking ahead to the next 10 years, what are the companies that could surpass Apple's enormous market cap? Here are two that could pull it off.

Image source: Getty Images.

Microsoft

If a company is going to surpass Apple over the next decade, it will need a gigantic market cap. Even assuming Apple's market cap holds steady, that would mean a company would need to reach a market cap of $3.4 trillion to catch Apple.

That's a very tall order, and there are only so many companies that could do it. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of them.

For starters, Microsoft already has a market cap of $3.1 trillion as of this writing. As recently as June, Microsoft did have a market cap larger than Apple. What's more, Microsoft holds a few competitive advantages that should, over time, help the company's market cap ease past Apple.

First, Microsoft has a more diversified business. The company has its hands in cloud computing, gaming, advertising, hardware, software, social networking, and artificial intelligence (AI). In short, Microsoft has many pathways to success. Apple, on the other hand, has traditionally benefited from its excellent hardware innovation. And while Apple services and AI could boost the company's revenue, flagging iPhone sales could present a real challenge to Apple over the next decade.

In my book, that means an advantage for Microsoft.

Nvidia

I have reservations about Nvidia right now. Its sky-high valuation makes it vulnerable to a nasty correction if the company's sales show any signs of slowing. That said, this article is about what could happen over the next 10 years. And in that case, I think Nvidia is well positioned to surpass Apple.

That's because Nvidia's core business -- making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that will power cutting-edge AI systems for the next decade -- is on a long-term growth trajectory that Apple simply can't match.

Sales of Apple's signature product -- the iPhone -- grew every year between 2007 and 2015, but they've been flat since then.

Image source: Statista.

Nvidia, on the other hand, is still growing. Over the last two years, the company has tripled its revenue as GPUs have sold like hotcakes. That growth isn't likely to slow in the next few years. Most analysts expect Nvidia's sales to double again to around $160 billion by 2026.

Story continues

Sure, there are likely to be some bumps in the road as the competitors take some market share from Nvidia in the red-hot AI chips market. But even if Nvidia's sales growth slows, it could easily close the $500 billion market cap difference between it and Apple over the next decade.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb sees room for Apple's (AAPL) stock price to climb, especially if the technology company successfully harnesses artificial intelligence for its iOS mobile operating system.

""Despite the stock’s recent strong appreciation, we see room for significant upside ahead as the magnitude of this new AI opportunity surprises,"" Loeb wrote to his investors in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Third Point built a position in Apple in April, Loeb wrote.

Loeb, whose firm oversees some $11 billion in assets, wrote that Apple was already one of the firm's top five winners during the second quarter when its TP Offshore Fund gained 1.8%. During the first half, the fund returned nearly 10%.

Apple, Loeb wrote, had been ""under-owned"" by institutional investors who feared the company might become an ""AI loser."" But Third Point has a different view, noting ""AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years.""

Demand for newer iPhones will grow as Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible and Apple's App Store will likely be the primary distribution platform for new consumer-focused AI apps, the letter said.

(AP) — Warren Buffett offered more details Wednesday about the stocks he has been selling lately, including confirming that he sold more than 389 million Apple shares during the second quarter.

Berkshire Hathaway still owns 400 million shares of the iPhone maker, so it remains the biggest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio, according to the company's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The news that Buffett had unloaded a huge chunk of Apple came out in Berkshire's earnings report earlier this month, but the exact number of shares he sold wasn't clear until Wednesday.

In addition to the big Apple sale, Berkshire has also been trimming its investments in Bank of America, Chevron, Capital One, Floor & Decor Holdings, T-Mobile and Louisiana Pacific recently. Berkshire also unloaded its nearly $1 billion Snowflake investment.

As a result of all the selling, Berkshire's already massive cash pile has ballooned to the record level of $277 billion.

But Berkshire did sink more money into the insurer Chubb and oil producer Occidental Petroleum, while revealing smaller new investments in aerospace parts maker Heico Corp. and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty.

The quarterly filings don't spell out which moves Buffett made and which actions were taken by one of the two other investment managers at Berkshire, but Buffett typically handles all the biggest investments worth more than $1 billion.

And many investors watch Buffett's actions closely because he has such a remarkably successful track record over the decades.

In addition to the nearly $300 billion stock portfolio, Berkshire owns several major insurers, including Geico, one of the nation's largest railroads in BNSF, a collection of big utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies. Its holdings include well-known brands like Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds and NetJets."

His latest moves in the stock market have captured the attention of investors. Under his control since 1965, he has led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK. A, BRK. B) to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 with his calculated decisions.

Don't Miss:

Buffett’s large stake in Apple (AAPL) has been a source of intrigue for years. Berkshire Hathaway began buying AAPL shares in 2016, and the technology giant became one of its largest holdings. Buffett previously had nice things to say about the technology giant, referring to it as a “better business” than other companies in Berkshire’s portfolio. Despite those positive comments, recent moves suggest Buffett is changing his strategy with Apple.

See Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

According to a report by CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway drastically reduced its stake from 905 million in Apple as of December 2023 to 400 million by June 2024, a 55% decline. Nobody might have expected this since Buffett has been a big admirer of the tech giant.

Perhaps this carries the sell-off reasoning toward Apple’s recent performance. The company still posted revenues of $85.8 billion in the June quarter – 4.8% above the same period last year – but the future outlook was grim.

See Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.

Sales on the Chinese market, a key market for Apple, plummeted by 6%, and the company’s operating income fared even worse with a 10% decrease. It lost its previous position in the top five smartphone companies within China, while competitive brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi fared very well. These problems and a valuation that some analysts believe appears stretched may have prompted Buffett to reassess his stance.

Despite trimming Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett remains bullish on another investment: Berkshire Hathaway. He has repurchased $5 billion of Berkshire shares in the last three quarters, indicating a bright outlook. “With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,” he wrote in a recent shareholder letter.

Story continues

Trending: Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

Berkshire Hathaway’s financial results have been outstanding despite its ups and downs. In June, the company reported a 1.2% revenue gain to $93.7 billion and a 16% rise in operating earnings to $11.6 billion.

The insurance group did particularly well, with earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investment up 56%. However, Berkshire’s GAAP net income dropped by 16%, to $30.3 billion, a number Buffett has called one that investors should pay very little attention to because of the volatility of unrealized gains and losses on stock investments.

Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

Analysts have long forecast Berkshire’s operating earnings to increase 10% in 2024 and then reduce by 3% growth in 2025. With Buffett’s ongoing buyback program, this would have given the appearance that he is getting extreme value for Berkshire Hathaway, even as he reduces his exposure to other assets, such as Apple.

Berkshire Hathaway could very well be a godsend for investors seeking a safe and stable long-term investment. If Warren Buffett continues to express so much faith in his own company, this might well be a green light for others to do the same.

Its climb centers around the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. A lot of this demand comes from big tech players, but one big tech company recently said no to Nvidia.

Although Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was late to the artificial intelligence game, its product was highly anticipated. To many people's surprise, Apple didn't use Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to create its AI model. Could this be a sign that Nvidia's GPU empire is starting to crack?

GPUs have been the most popular option for training AI models

Nvidia's GPUs have become incredibly popular for running AI workloads. Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, and it has industry-leading software available to help squeeze out every bit of performance from the GPUs. This is important as these servers that run AI models contain thousands of GPUs. GPUs are a top choice for this kind of workload because they can perform many calculations in parallel, unlike central processing units (CPUs) found in PCs. They are also good at other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, engineering simulations, and drug discovery.

But because they aren't purpose-built for AI calculations, there is likely a better way to process calculations. These chips exist and aren't made by any of Nvidia's traditional competitors.

One of these alternatives is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPU was designed specifically for these large AI computations but is limited in flexibility. If a workload is properly set up, TPUs blow Nvidia's GPUs' performance out of the water, but only for specific use cases.

This is the primary reason Apple selected Alphabet's TPUs to train its Apple Intelligence model. Does one of the largest players in the industry selecting purpose-built hardware rather than a broader one signify the end for Nvidia?

Nvidia's investment thesis hinges on customers buying more GPUs

Part of the reason some investors (like myself) are hesitant to buy into Nvidia's stock now is the extreme growth expectations built into the company. Anyone buying the stock now assumes that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will continue to grow significantly. However, they don't consider the possibility that once developers are used to setting up their AI models in a particular way, they may choose to use purpose-built hardware like the TPU.

This could be a thesis-breaker for Nvidia, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by 98% this year to $110 billion and by 36% next year to $151 billion. Should demand for its product drop, these projections could be in danger.

It's not just Alphabet with its custom design, either. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) both have their own custom chips that are purpose-built for AI model training. Neither of these three companies sells these products directly to the consumer. Instead, if clients want to access them, they must rent them through one of their cloud computing offerings.

This is a better long-term business model than Nvidia's, as once Nvidia sells its GPU, the only revenue it will get is from customers deciding to upgrade or replace the unit after its service life is complete. Cloud computing companies buy hardware and then rent the power to clients on a recurring basis, extending the value they can get from one unit.

Still, all three cloud giants' data centers are filled to the brim with Nvidia's GPUs, and they're all buying more. So, while there may be better ways to train AI models, many companies are still training on GPUs.

Time will tell whether this trend reverses and more companies train AI models like Apple did or GPUs for broader use continue to dominate. But it's a great point to remember if you're considering investing in Nvidia.

With those words from United States District judge Amit Mehta on Monday, Google suffered a historic antitrust case loss at the hands of the U.S. Department of Justice. Mehta, the judge presiding over the trial, ruled that the tech giant has illegally maintained a monopoly through the billions of dollars in annual payments it makes to partners to secure the default search engine position on popular web browsers and mobile phones. With those dominant positions locked in, the argument goes, other competitors in the search and search advertising businesses have no chance of competing effectively.

The ruling immediately prompted speculation about the impact to Apple, which receives as much as $20 billion from Google every year in exchange for putting the search engine front-and-center on its iPhones via the Apple Safari web browser.

But while Apple would certainly take a big hit if the ruling is upheld, Apple is a large, diversified company with many sources of revenue. That's not the case for another partner of Google's located in the fallout zone of Monday's ruling: Mozilla, the non-profit tech org that makes the Firefox web browser.

When users of Firefox type a search term into the browser, the query is automatically routed to Google's search engine. The arrangement is vital for Mozilla. According to the Mozilla Foundation's 2021-2022 financial statement, which is the most recent published, $510 million out of its $593 million in revenue came courtesy of Google's search payments.

If that number $510 million were to go away entirely, Mozilla will have a serious problem on its hands.

Mozilla is putting on a brave face for now, and not directly addressing the existential threat that the ruling appears to pose.

""Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune on Monday. ""We're closely reviewing the court's decision, considering its potential impact on Mozilla and how we can positively influence the next steps...Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users' preferences while fostering a competitive market.""

For Mozilla, which first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a community-driven project to challenge Microsoft's stranglehold on the web browser market via Internet Explorer, Monday's ruling is the latest setback in a quest to find relevance in a market dominated by Big Tech companies. Mozilla laid off about 60 staffers earlier this year and saw its CEO step down.

Story continues

You can be sure that critics of the judge's ruling will highlight the potentially devastating impact on Mozilla to make the case that the antitrust ruling will have unintended consequences on smaller tech industry players. Others might argue that Mozilla hasn't done enough with those spoils to differentiate its Firefox browser, or that it could cut a deal with another search engine like Bing if its Google deal goes away completely.

Either way, Google will appeal the suit so a long battle may ensue. And there's another big domino to fall: the judge will rule on the remedy or remedies — essentially, the business-model penalties — that Google will face.

Evercore ISI research analyst Mark Mahoney tacked them off in a research note on Monday evening:

""The exact remedy is key, and so far, it’s hard to pick a winning horse among a range of outcomes,"" he wrote. "" i) forbidding payment from Google altogether, ii) a cap on the amount of distribution agreement fees, iii) pushing Apple to implement a “choice screen”, or iv) something else? In any case, we expect at least another 6 months to a year before we would know the exact remedies (or longer if the judge decides to stay the remedies phase pending GOOG’s appeal).""

It may cost Apple (AAPL) big-time too.

Here's how: The ruling could force Google to make dramatic changes to its largest business, but it could also force the company to cancel a long-term revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires the iPhone maker to use Google as the default search engine across its various devices.

The deal, called an Information Services Agreement, has been in place since 2002 and has been adjusted over the years as new technologies, such as the iPhone, have been introduced. The gist of the deal is that Apple uses Google as its default search engine for its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri.

In return, Google pays Apple 36% of the search revenue generated on Apple devices using Google’s services. While Apple doesn’t reveal exactly how much it makes from the deal, court documents pegged the number at an estimated $20 billion in 2022, double what Google paid in 2020.

Apple couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The revenue from Google and Apple’s agreement is likely realized under Apple’s Services business segment, which is where it lists third-party advertising licensing agreements. In 2022, Apple saw $78.1 billion in Services revenue. If the $20 billion estimate is accurate, that means the deal accounted for roughly 25% of Apple’s Services revenue for the year.

Apple’s Services business is one of its fastest-growing segments and is seen as a bulwark against the company’s slowing iPhone sales. The company has expanded the segment significantly over the years, adding its Apple Music+ and Apple TV+ platforms to the business. But the Google deal still likely makes up a massive chunk of the Services segment’s revenue.

From a company-wide perspective, Apple generated $394.3 billion in revenue in 2022, meaning the Google agreement accounted for 5% of the company’s annual revenue for the year.

Losing the ISA wouldn’t just hurt Apple, though. According to court documents, Google performed internal modeling in 2020 that found it would lose 60% to 80% of search volume on Apple’s iOS devices if its search engine were replaced as the default option.

Losing that search volume would cut into Google’s bottom line to the tune of $28 billion to $32 billion. With Google bringing in $182.5 billion in revenue in 2020, that would slice $15% to 17% off of the company’s bottom line.

Story continues

Google is sure to appeal the DOJ’s win, but if Mehta’s ruling stands, Apple and Google could be in for some serious financial pain.

High-performing shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla fell as much as 12.2% in premarket trading.

The losses in the Magnificent Seven stocks were set to wipe out nearly $1 trillion from the combined market value of the companies.

Chip stocks, the big winners of Wall Street's picks and shovels trade for AI, also tumbled, with Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Super Micro Computer and Broadcom falling as much as 10.3%.

The share slide followed a weak U.S. payrolls report on Friday that pushed investors to safe assets and spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will have to soon cut interest rates to aid growth.

Over the weekend, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had halved its stake in Apple - the conglomerate's top holding - in a stock-selling spree that raised worries about the outlook for the tech industry.

Meanwhile, Nvidia shares took a hit from a report that the launch of its upcoming AI chips could be delayed by three months due to design flaws, which could impact customers such as Facebook-parent Meta, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft.

After driving gains on Wall Street for more than a year, big technology stocks have come under pressure in the past few weeks also on signs that the payoff from hefty AI investments would take longer than some investors had initially hoped.

Shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet - the three biggest providers of cloud-computing services - fell as their earnings reports dashed big bets of hefty AI investments translating quickly into growth.

""Expectations have arguably become too high for the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Their success has made them untouchable in the eyes of investors and when they fall short of greatness, out come the knives,"" Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash at Berkshire Hathaway soar to nearly $277 billion and selling a large chunk of its stake in Apple, even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating profit.

Berkshire sold about 390 million Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115 million shares from January to March, as Apple's stock price rose 23%. It still owned about 400 million shares worth $84.2 billion as of June 30.

The cash stake grew to $276.9 billion from $189 billion three months earlier largely because Berkshire sold a net $75.5 billion of stocks. It was the seventh straight quarter Berkshire sold more stocks than it bought.

Second-quarter profit from Berkshire's dozens of businesses rose 15% to $11.6 billion, or about $8,073 per Class A share, from $10.04 billion a year earlier.

Nearly half of that profit came from underwriting and investments in Berkshire's insurance businesses.

Net income fell 15% to $30.34 billion from $35.91 billion a year earlier, as rising stock prices in both periods boosted the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio, including Apple.

Buffett has long urged shareholders to ignore Berkshire's quarterly investment gains and losses, which often lead to outsized net profits or net losses.

Berkshire often lets cash build up when it can't find whole businesses or individual stocks to buy at fair prices.

Its cash may also signal concerns about the broader U.S. economy - many investors view Berkshire as a proxy for it.

Government data on Friday that showed slowing job growth and the highest unemployment rate since Oct. 2021 prompted some analysts to project multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts starting in September.

But Berkshire's returns from short-term Treasuries should decline once rate cuts begin.

Berkshire is also using less cash to buy back its own stock, repurchasing just $345 million in the second quarter and none in the first three weeks of July.

""We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's May 4 annual meeting, referring to Berkshire's cash.

Since mid-July, Berkshire has also sold more than $3.8 billion of shares in Bank of America, its second-largest stock holding.

Buffett remains a big Apple fan, reflecting the iPhone maker's strong pricing power and committed customer base.

He said at the meeting that he expected Apple to remain Berkshire's largest stock investment, but selling made sense because the 21% federal tax rate on the gains would likely grow.

Story continues

Buffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, building it into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a namesake real estate brokerage, and Dairy Queen.

Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 62, is expected to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.

Apple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.

Including the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.

In the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.

Apple did not comment on Monday.

The iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.

To build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.

Nvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.

Unlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.

Apple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.

Reuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.

Google did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.

Apple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.

Apple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.

The Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.

Even though the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" is just as fallible as any other investor, he's managed to deliver an aggregate return in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) that exceeds 4,940,000% since taking the reins in 1965.

Extensive books have been written highlighting the blueprint Buffett and his team have used to pick out top-tier investments for more than a half-century. While you can read about these ""ingredients"" in greater detail, the bare-bones approach for Buffett has always involved focusing on brand-name businesses that offers clear-cut competitive advantages.

Dividend stocks have paved the way to big gains for Berkshire Hathaway

However, there are other subtleties that have helped Berkshire Hathaway excel in the return column. One of these attributes, which tends to fly under the radar, is Warren Buffett's love for dividend stocks.

Publicly traded companies that regularly dole out dividends to their shareholders are typically profitable on a recurring basis and have proven their ability to navigate challenging economic conditions. Moreover, income stocks have a lengthy track record of crushing non-payers in the return department.

In 2023, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds released an extensive report, ""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future,"" which examined the many ways dividend-paying companies have outperformed for investors. In particular, one data set, calculated in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks averaged an annual return of 9.17% over the last 50 years (1973-2023), and did so while being 6% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500.

Meanwhile, non-payers generated a more modest 4.27% annualized average return over the same span and were 18% more volatile than the S&P 500.

The Oracle of Omaha understands that mature, dividend-paying businesses are just the type of companies that should increase in value over time. Not surprisingly, Berkshire Hathaway is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in dividend income over the next 12 months.

But not all dividend stocks are created equally. Among the 44-stock, $397 billion investment portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, one holding is set to generate more than $1 billion in dividend income by itself over the next year.

Many of Warren Buffett's core holdings are big-time dividend stocks

Another subtle but key facet of Berkshire Hathaway's ongoing success is its portfolio concentration. Despite holding stakes in 44 stocks, the lion's share of invested assets Buffett and his team oversee are put to work in just a handful of companies. Many of these core holdings are big-time dividend stocks.

Story continues

For example, Buffett's company has been holding shares of consumer staples titan Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) since 1988. As you can imagine, a 36-year holding period has left Berkshire with an exceptionally low (and highly favorable) cost basis in Coca-Cola of just $3.2475 per share. Given Coca-Cola's expected forward-year payout of $1.94 per share, Buffett's company is netting a roughly 60% yield on cost, relative to its initial investment of $1.3 billion. In dollars, Berkshire is collecting $776 million annually from its position in Coke.

What's made Coca-Cola such a special investment is its geographic diversity and top-tier marketing efforts. With regard to the former, it operates in all but three countries globally (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia). This means it generates predictable operating cash flow in developed/established markets, and can move the organic growth needle by pushing into emerging market regions.

As for its marketing, Coca-Cola can rely on more than a century of history to connect with its mature consumers. Meanwhile, it leans on digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to engage with its younger audience.

Tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is another core holding for Berkshire Hathaway that's generating a boatload of annual dividend income. Although it hasn't raised its base annual payout for 62 consecutive years like Coca-Cola, Apple did recently increase its quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share to $0.25. Apple doling out $1 per share over 12 months will net Berkshire Hathaway north of $789 million in dividend income.

Innovation explains why Apple accounts for 44% ($175 billion) of Berkshire's invested assets. Apple's iPhone has pretty consistently controlled a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since 5G-capable versions initially hit retail shelves in late 2020. CEO Tim Cook is also overseeing the steady evolution of Apple to a platform's company. A focus on subscription services should provide a boost to the company's operating margin over time.

Say hello to the only stock putting over $1 billion in annual dividend income into Berkshire's coffers

While Coca-Cola and Apple are income superstars for Warren Buffett's company, it's money-center behemoth Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) that sits atop the dividend income pecking order.

Following the latest round of annual bank stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, ""BofA,"" as Bank of America is commonly known, announced that it would be increasing its quarterly payout from $0.24 to $0.26 per share. Although a $0.02/share payout bump might not sound like much, it can make a sizable difference for Buffett's company, which holds more than 1 billion shares of BofA stock. A $1.04 per share dividend over the next 12 months from Bank of America will translate into roughly $1.074 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway.

The secret sauce that often allows bank stocks to dole out mammoth dividends is their cyclical ties.

To state the obvious, recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic boom-and-bust cycle. However, recessions are historically short-lived, with only three contractions since the end of World War II lasting longer than a year. By comparison, a majority of economic expansions endure for multiple years. These non-linear cycles allow bank stocks like BofA to meaningfully expand their loan portfolios and reap the reward of interest income.

Speaking of interest income, arguably no large bank has benefited more from the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy than Bank of America. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is great news for the most interest-sensitive money-center bank on Wall Street. The longer the nation's central bank stands pat on interest rates, the more net-interest income Bank of America can collect.

Although BofA probably isn't the first (or even 10th) name you'd think of when it comes to financial technology and digitization, the company's investments in technology have decisively paid off. Over time, a higher percentage of its consumer households are banking digitally and completing loan sales online or via mobile app. It's considerably cheaper for banks to interact with their customers online or via mobile app as opposed to in-person or over the phone. This digital push is making BofA a more efficient bank.

Lastly, Bank of America has a rock-solid leader in Brian Moynihan. In the wake of the Great Recession, BofA was one of America's most-fined financial institutions. Since becoming Bank of America CEO in 2010, Moynihan has predominantly led his company with a conservative, risk-off approach that favors a robust capital-return program.

When it comes to dividend income, Bank of America is in a tier of its own within the $397 billion investment portfolio overseen by Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.

The company has informed the state Department of Commerce it seeks to suspend the project for four years, according to a source familiar with the site. In a statement Monday, Apple said it is still “looking forward to developing our new campus in the coming years” and noted it has added around 600 positions in the Raleigh area since the company announced its RTP campus in April 2021.

Three years ago, Apple committed to invest at least a half-billion dollars to build a new campus on the Wake County side of RTP by the end of 2031. No construction has begun.

Site plans filed last summer showed the campus would include three office buildings, three accessory buildings and a parking garage —totaling nearly 900,000 square feet on either side of N.C. 540.

The company will only benefit from North Carolina’s job development investment grant — worth up to $845 million in payroll tax benefits through the year 2061 — if it reaches certain annual hiring and investment targets.

While the company has more than six years to complete its campus, its hiring clock began last year with an obligation to have added a minimum of 126 local workers. This jobs target increases to 378 total positions by the end of 2024 and increases up to 2,700 jobs in 2032.

For now, Apple leases office space at the MetLife campus in Cary. The California-based tech giant has also purchased a four-story, 139,000-square-foot building in Durham, near the RDU airport, according to multiple sources familiar with that site.

The Triangle Business Journal first reported on Apple’s planned pause Monday.

Apple said it would not expect to receive taxpayer benefits while its agreement is delayed, but it is not yet clear what actions North Carolina could take at this time to adjust the company’s incentive deal timeline.

In a statement Monday, Gov. Roy Cooper expressed confidence in Apple’s future in the Triangle.

“I have spoken with officials at Apple, and they emphasized their commitment to build this transformative campus here in North Carolina,” Cooper said.

A slew of regulatory concerns and more smartphone competition in China, the company's second-largest market, weighed on investor sentiment. But the stock reversed course once management began disclosing more info about the company's generative artificial intelligence system, Apple Intelligence. Wall Street has been upbeat that AI-integrated iPhones could lead to a boost in device sales as users trade up to newer models. A batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports also helped. Analysts are increasingly recognizing that Apple's high-margin services business , which includes recurring revenue streams from subscriptions, is key to the stock's success. '25 look ahead Apple stock has never been this expensive on a forward p/e basis, so it's hard to determine how much more rally it has left. As a result, the Club is considering a trim before the company's next quarterly earnings report in February. But this will depend on whether Apple can show us that it doesn't need to rely so heavily on hardware sales alone. Jim Cramer said Apple's services business needs to outperform, citing a potential increase in revenues from the App Store. ""We figured that if the company is no longer going to be hostage to big [iPhone] launches it makes sense that the price-to-earnings multiple should expand,"" Jim said during the December Monthly Meeting , where he also reiterated that Apple remains one of 12 core holdings in the portfolio going into 2025. Apple also needs to show investors signs of a turnaround in China, where the company makes most of its devices. Softening iPhone demand in the region, along with President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff increases , pose challenges for Apple moving forward. Over time, Apple's expansion into emerging markets like India to diversify the company's supply chain will help mitigate those risks, Jim said. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL.

House Committee members are urging the top executives of Apple and Google to be prepared to comply with a law that could result in TikTok facing an effective ban in the U.S. next month

Letters were sent on Friday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai from Reps. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, reminding them of their responsibilities as app store operators.

The lawmakers were referring to last week's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to uphold a law that requires China's ByteDance to divest TikTok by Jan. 19. If ByteDance fails to sell TikTok by that date, Apple and Google will be required by law to ensure that their platforms no longer support the TikTok app in the U.S., the lawmakers wrote.

""As you know, without a qualified divestiture, the Act makes it unlawful to '[p]rovid[e] services to distribute, maintain, or update such foreign adversary controlled application (including any source code of such application) by means of a marketplace (including an online mobile application store) through which users within the land or maritime borders of the United States may access, maintain, or update such application,'"" the lawmakers wrote in the letters.

They also sent a letter to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, reviewing the court decision. They said that since President Joe Biden passed the original TikTok law in April, ""Congress has provided ample time for TikTok to take the necessary steps to come into compliance.""

""Indeed, TikTok has had 233 days and counting to pursue a solution that protects U.S. national security,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Although TikTok called the law unconstitutional and said it violates the First Amendment rights of its 170 million users, a three-judge panel on the appeals court rejected that argument and said in an opinion that the law ""is narrowly tailored to protect national security.""

TikTok has since filed an emergency motion for an injunction to stop the ban from taking effect until the U.S. Supreme court can hear its appeal. The company warned that one month of a U.S. ban would result in U.S. small businesses and social media creators losing $1.3 billion in sales and earnings.

President-elect Donald Trump has not publicly stated whether he plans to enforce the effective TikTok ban when he officially takes office on Jan. 20.

Trump tried to push through a ban in his first administration, but his rhetoric on TikTok began to turn after the president-elect met in February with billionaire Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor and a major investor in the Chinese-owned social media app.

Yass's trading firm Susquehanna International Group owns a 15% stake in ByteDance while Yass maintains a 7% stake in the company, equating to about $21 billion, NBC and CNBC reported in March. That month it was also reported that Yass was a part owner of the business that merged with the parent company of Trump's Truth Social .

Apple, Google and TikTok didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple's software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won't store requests. The integration uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

Apple users don't need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.

The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup's marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company's suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.

Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.

The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.

Many investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.

The integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.

Users need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.

After updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple's AI models, that the service needs to operate.

The Monday updates also include Apple's image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs."

The news The added Apple Intelligence features — including the infusion of the OpenAI chatbot and new image-generating and editing tools — became available to the public Wednesday in the latest version of the company's mobile operating system, iOS 18.2. Apple provided a test version of the update to software developers back in October. What's so exciting about the new iOS 18.2 release? It introduces a more powerful Siri, which gives users asking more complex questions the option to seamlessly get answers from ChatGPT, as well as Apple's AI image-generating app Playground and its new Image Wand removal tool. Artificial intelligence Genmojis are also part of the update. To be sure, Apple Intelligence is only available on newer Apple devices, specifically the iPhone 15 Pro and this year's iPhone 16 models. In recent years, people have been holding onto their devices for longer — up to four years. So, it's about the time that users with older models, purchased during the Covid pandemic when many upgraded their devices and computer technology, could take action. AAPL 5Y mountain Apple 5 years Shares of Apple rose roughly 1% on Wednesday, following eight sessions in a row of all-time intraday highs. The stock on Tuesday posted a record-high close for the third straight day. Big picture Apple Intelligence — first introduced by CEO Tim Cook at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference back in June — was expected to usher in a robust iPhone refresh cycle. While still expected, device upgrades have gotten off to a slower-than-anticipated start — largely attributed to the AI features not being available when the new iPhone 16 lineup was launched back in September. While some of the AI tools were released in October, they were lackluster. Wednesday's rollout of the ChatGPT integration with Siri, however, was highly anticipated and could be the push to get prospective iPhone upgraders off the fence. Certain Macs and iPads will have access to the newest AI features as well. And, there's more to come. Apple plans to release another AI update next year. It's expected to include additional Siri upgrades, including the ability for the digital assistant to take actions inside of apps. As Jim Cramer has posited, some Wall Street analysts also think that the piecemeal release of Apple Intelligence can work to the company's advantage. Citi on Tuesday named the megacap name a top pick for 2025. ""Overall, a staggered rollout of iOS18.2/3/4 Apple Intelligence features makes [iPhone 16/17] cycle different from prior cycles,"" said the Citi analysts, who reiterated their buy rating on the stock. ""Rollout of iOS18.2 in December will be an important determinant for the pace of iPhone replacement in the coming quarters."" They added, ""We remain optimistic about [the] iPhone 17 refresh cycle."" Bottom line Jeff Marks, director of Club portfolio analysis, said Wednesday that as more and more iPhone users upgrade and start using the Apple Intelligence features word-of-mouth should get more people to stop dragging their feet. ""It seems like it's going to be a word-of-mouth situation. As people get the phone and they show some of these new features to their friends, maybe there will be some [fear of missing out] there and that leads to the upgrade cycle,"" he added. ""That's why the stock keeps going higher,"" Jim said, adding that Apple shares trading at nearly 33 times forward earnings-per-share estimates will look cheap when EPS estimates need to be raised to account for the iPhone cycle heats up. Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio averaged 26.5 times over the past five years. It's not just devices. AI adoption also could boost Apple's high-margin services business if users are willing to pay monthly fees to access additional Apple Intelligence features down the line. Jim has said that ""AI will be a hit"" for Apple and revenue streams for the services business ""could go up dramatically"" because of it. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL.

Appearing on the CNBC Sport videocast with Alex Sherman, Garber, who just signed a new contract with MLS through 2027, said more than 12 million fans attended games this year. And that enthusiasm translated to watching games outside the stadium, too.

""We have more subscribers than we and Apple thought we would have. We have more people watching our games,"" Garber said.

Apple has not released any subscriber numbers, leading some to speculate that the numbers might not be very strong.

""At some point there'll be more transparency,"" Garber said.

Yet the soccer commissioner said he's exceedingly happy with the relationship, noting that Apple gives MLS the platform to make every single game a national game. They've also streamlined start times, meaning matches now begin at two different times instead of 60 different times to make it easier for fans to tune in.

""We have the ability to have technology and data and multi-stream experiences, things we wouldn't have been able to do with linear, perhaps even with other streaming services,"" Garber said. ""So when you can partner with a company like Apple, you have opportunity to solve issues and lean into a better future.""

Meanwhile, Garber is preparing for the 2024 MLS Cup to kick off in Los Angeles on Saturday. But MLS' crown jewel Lionel Messi will not be playing.

Instead, the LA Galaxy will try to reclaim their place as MLS's most successful club, having already won a record five MLS Cups. They will play the New York Red Bulls, who are seeking their first-ever MLS Cup and had a dramatic turnaround after finishing last season 26th out of 29 clubs.

""That shows the commitment to, you know, a competition parity that any team could win on any given time,"" Garber said.

Garber acknowledged that Messi's impact on the game has been unprecedented.

""You could see that pink InterMiami jersey everywhere around the world. It's the No. 1 jersey that Adidas has,"" he said.

But he isn't worried about life after Messi as he points to the exciting pipeline of younger players.

""I think there'll be another Messi at some point,"" Garber said. ""And we've constantly evolved from having big name players that could could really make a difference and break through this very, very busy market."""

Apple revealed its usage of Amazon's proprietary chips at the annual AWS Reinvent conference on Tuesday. Benoit Dupin, Apple's senior director of machine learning and AI, took the stage to discuss how Apple uses the cloud service. It's a rare example of the company officially allowing a supplier to tout them as a customer.

""We have a strong relationship, and the infrastructure is both reliable and able to serve our customers worldwide,"" Apple's Dupin said.

Apple's appearance at Amazon's conference and its embrace of the company's chips is a strong endorsement of the cloud service as it vies with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for AI spending. Apple uses those cloud services, too.

Benoit said that Apple had used AWS for over a decade for services including Siri, Apple Maps and Apple Music. Apple has used Amazon's Trainium and Graviton chips to serve search services, for example, and Benoit said that Amazon's chips had led to a 40% efficiency gain.

But Benoit also suggested that Apple would use Amazon's Trainium2 chip to pre-train its proprietary models. It's a sign that Amazon's chips aren't just a cost-effective way to inference AI models compared to x86 central processors made by Intel and AMD, but can also be used to develop new AI. Amazon announced on Tuesday that its Trainium2 chip was generally available to rent.

""In early stages of evaluating Trainium2 we expect early numbers up to 50% improvement in efficiency with pre-training,"" Dupin said.

Earlier this year, Apple said in a research paper that it had used Google Cloud's TPU chips to train its iPhone AI service, which it calls Apple Intelligence.

The majority of AI training is done on pricey Nvidia graphics processors. Cloud providers and startups are racing to develop alternatives to lower costs and are exploring different approaches that could lead to more efficient processing. Apple's usage of custom chips could signal to other companies that non-Nvidia training approaches can work.

AWS is expected to announce new details on Tuesday about offering Nvidia Blackwell-based AI servers for rent, too.

Apple released its first major generative AI product this fall. Apple Intelligence is a series of services that can summarize notifications, rewrite emails, and generate new emojis. Later this month, it will integrate with OpenAI's ChatGPT, the company says, and next year, Siri will get new abilities to control apps and speak naturally.

Unlike leading chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Apple's approach to AI isn't based on large clusters of Nvidia-based servers in the cloud. Instead, Apple uses an iPhone, iPad or Mac chip to do as much of the processing as possible, and then sends complicated queries to Apple-operated servers using its own M-series chips."

It's hard to argue with the results, though. And if you dig a little more into the process, Gronkowski's trade starts to look similar to that of another famous Apple investor: Warren Buffett .

After selling some shares along the way, Gronk says his Apple stake is currently worth more than $600,000.

""I [had] never been involved in stocks,"" Gronkowski said. ""I really didn't know how stocks work. So I was like, 'All right, let me do this, man.'""

Future hall-of-fame tight end Rob Gronkowski says he bought $69,000 worth of Apple stock in 2014 based on advice from a contractor working on his Foxborough, Massachusetts, home, reports Fortune .

Would the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway ever invest in a company without doing exhaustive research, let alone on the advice of a contractor? Unlikely. But Berkshire's purchase of $31 billion of Apple stock in 2016 wasn't Buffett's idea. The self-described luddite greenlit Berkshire's purchase on the advice of lieutenant Ted Weschler.

It's possible that both Gronk and Buffett recognized that Apple had become a ubiquitous company with a product — the iPhone — that inspired enormous loyalty among customers. It's a quality of the business Buffett has consistently touted since.

""Apple has a position with consumers that they're paying $1,500 or whatever it may be for a phone, and these same people pay $35,000 for a second car,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's 2023 shareholder meeting. ""And if they had to give up their second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car!""

Was Gronk thinking that deeply about it back in 2014? Probably not. But he may well have recognized that Apple was a strong business with an industry-leading brand.

Buffett is one of the greatest-ever investors, while Gronk has a propensity for absent-mindedness. That's perhaps why, after making his investment, he forgot about his Apple shares for two and half years. By the time he remembered where he'd stashed the money, his investment had grown to more than $250,000.

That's certainly not Buffett-like behavior, but it's not far off from the Oracle of Omaha's advice for everyday investors. While he generally recommends that regular people own low-cost, diversified index funds, he says that those who do invest in individual stocks would be wise to hold them over long periods without paying attention to their day-to-day movements.

""You shouldn't buy stocks unless you expect...to hold them for a very extended period and you are prepared financially and psychologically to hold them the same way you would hold a farm, and never look at a quote,"" Buffett said at the 2020 Berkshire meeting. ""You don't need to pay attention to them.""

Buffett's reasoning here is straightforward. Monitoring the ups and downs of a particular stock can lead you to make emotional decisions driven by short-term thinking. You're better off, he says, owning a great company over a long period.

Kinga Krzeminska | Moment | Getty Images

Ireland goes to the polls on Nov. 29, with center-right parties Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael once again expected to form the nucleus of the country's next government. The historical rivals have shared power over the last five years alongside the Green Party, and the latest opinion polls show the two riding high, as the election campaign enters its final days. Whoever leads the country following the vote will face some unique economic challenges and opportunities: Ireland has a budget surplus, driven by its unique position as a European headquarters for major U.S. tech and pharmaceutical companies, while its balance sheet was boosted by a September ruling of the European Court of Justice, which ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in back taxes to the country. On the flipside, there are concerns in Dublin that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will look to clamp down on U.S. companies paying taxes in Ireland, instead of in America.

Political angle

The country's two biggest parties look once again on track to form a government, despite some travails for Fine Gael as the campaign winds down. The latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll of Nov. 25 shows support for Fine Gael falling six points to 19% over the last two weeks, while Fianna Fáil's backing now stands at 21%. Support for Republican Party Sinn Féin, which posted major gains in the previous general election, currently sits at 20%, while independent candidates are polling at 17%. Ireland uses proportional voting, and if no party can claim a majority in the election, a coalition is certain. It is nevertheless unclear what policy changes can be expected, given the sway that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are likely to have in a potential government. Housing is a significant issue, with the Central Bank of Ireland warning in a recent September report that Ireland's ""housing market has been subject to more than a decade of under-supply"", adding that the surge in rent and house prices has stretched affordability. The central bank went on to forecast that ""around 52,000 new homes could be needed per year out to the middle of the century, or a 20,000 unit increase relative to 2023 supply."" Homelessness across the country, particularly in Dublin, has reached record levels, with almost 15,000 people in emergency accommodation in September, of whom 4,561 were children, according to official figures. Despite concerns over tight housing supply, Emma Howard, economist at TU Dublin, said in an email to CNBC that Ireland still remains attractive to workers, given that it is ""the only English speaking country with access to the European single market, and we have a relatively younger and more education workforce than our European counterparts.""

Budget bonus

The good news is that the country's finances are on a strong footing, more than a decade after the government sought a bailout from the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission. A budget surplus has been recorded in the last two years, with Finance Minister Jack Chambers revealing in September that the country expects to record a surplus of up to €24 billion this year, driven by the ECJ ruling. An additional boost came in mid-November when S&P Global Ratings upped its outlook on Ireland to positive from stable, adding that it could potentially revise its ratings to AAA — the agency's highest grade— if Dublin ""continues to rebuild economic and fiscal buffers."" The report nevertheless came with a warning for authorities that 10 foreign-owned multinational enterprises were responsible for half of the country's corporate tax receipts in 2023. However, Howard says ""if the 'windfall' corporation taxes are removed, the proportion of government revenue that is not from domestic economic activity, Ireland actually has a budget deficit, and over the period 2024-2030 the current spending plans add up to a deficit of €50 billion."" Many of these are U.S. companies, and this is where clouds could appear on the horizon for the country.

In an interview with Fortune this week, Gronkowski revealed that he benefitted from a piece of investing advice that helped him make hundreds of thousands of dollars.

As a 25-year-old in 2014, the Patriots tight end had very little experience investing. But when the contractor who was building his house in Foxborough, Mass. urged him to invest in Apple, Gronkowski decided to give it a shot.

""I'd never been involved in stocks. I really didn't know how stocks worked,"" he said. ""So I was like, 'Alright, let me do this. I'm going to go big.'""

Gronkowski, who through the 2014 season had earned a little over $16 million from the NFL, called up his financial adviser and directed them to purchase $69,000 worth of shares of the iPhone maker.

The five-time Pro Bowler said that he promptly forgot about his purchase until two and a half years later, when he realized that his investment had grown to be worth around $250,000. At that point, Gronkowski cashed out his initial $69,000 investment and left the rest to grow.

""To this date, I have over $600,000 of Apple stock, all because of the investment I made in 2014, having no idea what I was doing but just listening to the man who built my house here in New England,"" he said.

While his Apple investment paid off handsomely — the company's stock is up more than 1,000% since 2014 — Gronkowski didn't need the financial assist. The Super Bowl champion famously refused to spend his NFL paychecks, choosing instead to live off of his endorsement money.

In a 2020 interview with CNBC Make It, he said he always wanted to be prepared financially for the day the football paychecks stopped coming in.

""The whole point of saving throughout my NFL career was to be set for after football because you don't know how long football will last,"" he said at the time.

The financial discipline has allowed him to enjoy his sporting retirement without having to worry about continuing to make money.

""It feels good to be in [this] position,"" he said. ""It feels good just to go out there and try to find things that I would just love to do.""

The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority issued a report Friday with a provisional decision from an independent inquiry group tasked by the regulator with carrying out an in-depth review of the mobile browser markets.

In the report, the group recommended that the CMA investigates Apple and Google's activities in mobile ecosystems under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC), a new U.K. law coming into force next year which seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets.

The DMCC is akin to the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. It gives the CMA the ability to designate firms as having ""Strategic Market Status"" (SMS) — which means they have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital business.

Under the rules, the CMA can impose major behavioral changes on firms that have SMS status, including ending ""self-preferencing"" of their own services, requiring interoperability — essentially allowing one piece of software to work with another smoothly — and banning anti-competitive behavior.

The CMA is required to undertake a formal investigation to give a firm SMS status.

For Apple specifically, the CMA inquiry group said it was concerned the tech giant's App Store rules ""restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers"" — for example, faster webpage loading on iPhone apps.

It added many smaller U.K. developers said they would like to use ""progressive"" web apps — which allow firms to offer apps outside of an app store — but that this technology ""is not able to fully take off on iOS devices.""

The group also said it found a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple to make Google the default search engine on iPhone ""significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS."""

The Indonesian government expects Apple to increase its proposed $100 million investment into the country, according to state media, as the iPhone maker seeks clearance from Jakarta to sell its latest phones.

The American tech giant's latest smartphone model doesn't meet Indonesia's 40% domestic content requirements for smartphones and tablets and hasn't been granted clearance to be sold in the country.

The purpose of the ban is to protect local industry and jobs, with officials asking Apple to increase its investments and commitments to the economy in order to gain greater access.

According to a report from Indonesian state media, the country's Ministry of Industry met with representatives from Apple on Thursday regarding its proposal to invest $100 million over two years.

The funds would go toward a research and development center program and professional development academy in the country, as per the report.

The company also plans to produce accessory product components, specifically mesh for Apple's AirPods Max, starting in July 2025, it added.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

While the new offer is 10 times larger than a proposal that was reported earlier, the government is still striving to sweeten the deal to get a ""fair"" commitment.

""From the government's perspective, of course, we want this investment to be larger,"" industry ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif told state media on Thursday.

He said that a larger investment would help the development of Indonesia's manufacturing sector, adding that its domestic industry was capable of supporting production of Apple devices such as chargers and accessories.

While Indonesia represents a small market for Apple, it also offers growth opportunities as it has the world's fourth-largest population, according to Le Xuan Chiew, a Canalys analyst focusing on Apple strategy research.

""Its young, tech-savvy population with growing digital literacy aligns with Apple's strategy to expand [global sales],"" he said, noting that it also offers potential for manufacturing and assembly that supports Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain.

Success in this market requires a long-term approach, and Apple's investment offer demonstrates a commitment to complying with local regulations and paving the way for future growth, he added."

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday issued a finalized version of a rule saying it will soon supervise nonbank firms that offer financial services likes payments and wallet apps.

Tech giants and payments firms that handle at least 50 million transactions annually will fall under the review, which is meant to ensure the newer entrants adhere to the laws that banks and credit unions abide by, the CFPB said in a release. That would include popular services from Apple and Google , as well as payment firms like PayPal and Block .

While the CFPB already had some authority over digital payment companies because of its oversight of electronic fund transfers, the new rule allows it to treat tech companies more like banks. It makes the firms subject to ""proactive examinations"" to ensure legal compliance, enabling it to demand records and interview employees.

""Digital payments have gone from novelty to necessity and our oversight must reflect this reality,"" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. ""The rule will help to protect consumer privacy, guard against fraud, and prevent illegal account closures.""

A year ago, the CFPB said it wanted to extend its oversight to tech and fintech companies that offer financial services but that have sidestepped more scrutiny by partnering with banks. Americans are increasingly using payment apps as de facto bank accounts, storing cash and making everyday purchases through their mobile phones.

The most popular apps covered by the rule collectively process more than 13 billion consumer payments a year, and have gained ""particularly strong adoption"" among low- and middle-income users, the CFPB said on Thursday.

""What began as a convenient alternative to cash has evolved into a critical financial tool, processing over a trillion dollars in payments between consumers and their friends, families, and businesses,"" the regulator said.

The initial proposal would've subjected companies that process at least 5 million transactions annually to some of the same examinations that the CFPB conducts on banks and credit unions. That threshold got raised to 50 million transactions in the final rule, the agency said Thursday.

Payment apps that only work at a particular retailer, like Starbucks , are excluded from the rule.

The new CFPB rule is one of the rare instances where the U.S. banking industry publicly supported the regulator's actions; banks have long felt that tech firms making inroads in financial services ought to be more scrutinized.

The news Bernstein analysts led by Toni Sacconaghi told clients that Apple is still their best idea, laying out a clear path to more upside for the iPhone maker's shares. In fact, Bernstein's bull case sees the stock surging to $290 a share in fiscal year 2026, implying 27% upside from Tuesday's close. Apple is currently in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025. ""We view Apple as a quality compounder, with mid-single digit revenue growth, improving margins, disciplined capital return, and double-digit [earnings per share] growth,"" wrote the analysts, who reiterated their buy-equivalent rating. Additionally, Bernstein argued that Apple's stock is less expensive than it appears thanks to the way Apple manages its inventory and payments to suppliers — basically, it collects cash from customers before it needs to pay its device manufacturers, creating what is known as a negative cash conversion cycle. That's a quality dynamic that not every company has. Analysts also cited catalysts such as generative artificial intelligence adoption , which could lead to increased revenue opportunities and an accelerated device upgrade down the line. ""Investors have fared well by maintaining AAPL as a core holding, and adding to positions on pullbacks,"" Bernstein wrote. Shares of the iPhone maker are down 1.3% Wednesday as Nvidia's decline weighs on the broader market. Big picture Bernstein's note wasn't the only positive news investors received this week. Apple's App Store revenues increased 2.6% in October compared with September — an acceleration from September's 2.3% month-over-month decline. That's according to a JPMorgan note Tuesday, which cited data from market research firm Sensor Tower. ""We view the latest monthly revenue trends for the App Store as supportive of the robust forecasts for Apple's Service revenue for F1Q25,"" wrote the JPMorgan analysts, who maintained their buy-equivalent rating on the stock. Others on the Street shared more cautious commentary on Apple. UBS said Tuesday that demand for new iPhone 16 models has been ""relatively muted"" since its release in September. ""We think that there is limited upside to our 78M sell-in unit estimate in the Dec-24 quarter even as consumers familiarize themselves with Apple Intelligence,"" analysts at the firm wrote. UBS maintained its hold-equivalent rating on the stock. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Bottom line Sacconaghi's positive call on Apple affirmed the Club's long-held ""own it, don't trade"" thesis. ""This piece makes me feel more confident [about Apple],"" Jim said Wednesday. He added that the Bernstein research shows investors that ""you don't sell the stock even if the quarter may not be up to snuff, even if Christmas may not be up to snuff with iPhone 16 [sales]."" Meanwhile, JPMorgan provided a timely reminder of the importance of Apple's high-margin services business, which hit a $100 billion run rate in its latest quarter . As for the more bearish commentary, Jim said that iPhone sales can pick up as the tech giant expands further into emerging markets. China has been Apple's second-largest market, but the region is facing plenty of headwinds. These include softening iPhone demand on more domestic competition, and Donald Trump's proposed tariff increases . But Apple's pivot into other markets like India, the Philippines and Indonesia should eventually offset those risks. ""They are transitioning in a very deft way from making China by far their biggest market to India,"" Jim said. ""And it's going to take a while, but there's no doubt in my mind that they understand India better than any American company... I'm very positive on that.""

At the time that meant four computers: Two laptops and two desktops, each in a pro and consumer version.

""If we had four great products, that's all we need,"" Jobs said at a product launch in 1998.

Three decades later, Apple's product lineup is much broader. The company in 2024 launched four iPads, four MacBooks, two desktop Macs, one Vision Pro headset, two Apple Watch models and three kinds of AirPods. But when it comes to iPhones, four remains the magic number.

That's how many iPhones the company has released each year since 2020, and in September, it released the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Apple introduced the four-phone lineup because historically the company's iPhone sales have seen the strongest growth when it expanded the lineup. If Apple can show growth from the four new phones it releases each year without them cannibalizing one another, that gives the company its best chance to see iPhone sales grow meaningfully for the first time since 2022.

The company doesn't give sales figures for its individual products, and overall iPhone sales for fiscal 2024 came in at $201.18 billion. That's relatively flat going back to 2022.

Unfortunately for Jobs' company, not all of the iPhones are equally popular.

Every year since 2020, one of the new iPhone models has lagged its siblings in sales. This year it's the iPhone 16 Plus, which lands in the middle of the lineup. At $899 in the U.S., it's more expensive than the baseline iPhone 16 but cheaper than the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, which have better screens.

DSCC, a research firm focused on the smartphone display industry with estimates derived from the panel supply chain, has picked up on this trend. The shares of the Pro and Pro Max phones have been rising on an annual basis while the Plus model declined from about 21% of total Apple screen orders in 2022 to 10% in 2023, according to DSCC's data for annual panel procurement through October. While it recovered somewhat to 16% this year, it's still the lowest volume out of the company's new iPhones, according to DSCC.

""They're still really struggling with this fourth model,"" DSCC founder Ross Young said.

Other data shows the Plus lagging, too. The iPhone 16 Plus accounted for 4% of overall iPhone sales in the U.S. in the third quarter while both the Pro and Pro Max each accounted for 6% of sales, according to survey findings by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The regular 16 accounted for 4%, too, although early cycle iPhone sales are heavily weighted toward early adopters and the Pro models, according to CIRP.

The metric only includes a few weeks of the latest model sales in the third quarter, but the 2024 findings are in line with last year's, where the 15 Plus accounted for 3% of total sales about a month after launch.

Apple's iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max took the top three spots, respectively, in Counterpoint's data for the best-selling individual smartphone models around the world in the third quarter of 2024. The Plus model didn't make the top 10 list."

Samsung's smart ring debut earlier this year has put the product firmly in the spotlight, with one analyst predicting earlier this year that Apple could launch its own smart ring in 2026.

But Tom Hale, CEO of Oura — which has been developing smart rings since the company was established in 2013 — said he doesn't think Apple will enter the space.

""I think they [Apple] are unconvinced about the value of having a ring and a watch together and they're not interested in undercutting the Apple Watch as a business,"" Hale told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.

""I think they're probably keeping a close eye on Samsung and a close eye on us, but it's hard to do this product category right.""

Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple has put a large focus on health applications through the Apple Watch and related services."

The news Trump's decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election comes with varying implications for Apple investors. Trump is seen as being more lenient on regulatory issues, which would be a boon to Apple and its Big Tech brethren. However, Trump has also promised hefty tariffs on imported goods from China where Apple does nearly 20% of its business and manufactures many of its key products. Bank of America analysts feel Trump could help fix Apple's regulatory woes in the U.S. and abroad. Earlier this year, the Justice Department sued Apple — alleging the company's iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly. At the time, Apple said the lawsuit had no merit and would defend against it. European regulators have also accused Apple of breaching their new tech rules — imposing billions of dollars in fines for allegedly thwarting competition. BofA analysts said an incoming Republican administration may be ""more inclined to favorably resolve"" these cases and push European officials for less regulation. Trump's proposed tariffs could spell trouble for Apple's flagship device. That's because not only is the iPhone Apple's biggest money maker but the majority of the company's products are made in China. Trump has proposed a 60% or higher tariff on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. That's compared to the 7.5% to 25% rates levied during his first term. Apple got exceptions in Trump's first term that muted the impact of tariffs on Apple. Without similar accommodations this time around, Apple might need to more move of its manufacturing to countries like India. Management would face a choice of raising prices on iPhones and other devices or accepting lower margins. Bernstein analysts considered the options, saying, ""IT hardware companies could combat tariffs by accelerating their supply chain migrations away from China, and look to reduce [operating expenses] — but neither would be easy nor quick to do."" Shares of Apple were basically flat in afternoon trading Wednesday, considerably underperforming the market and other large tech players, such as Amazon , Nvidia and Microsoft. We own all three for the Club. Big picture These complex issues facing Apple come as CEO Tim Cook has strived for a good working relationship with Trump over the years. In a note to employees in 2016, Cook wrote, ""I've never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,"" explaining why he showed up to talk to Trump despite supporting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in that election. Cook's efforts to build relationships with the Trump administration worked in Apple's favor at the time, according to Rosenblatt analysts. ""Trump, in his first term was moving ahead with 15% duties on imports of Chinese-made consumer goods to be imposed starting in December 2019 into the holiday shopping period,"" they said in a note Wednesday. ""At the last minute, the administration backed down and announced a 'Phase One' trade deal with China."" The Rosenblatt analysts recalled that Trump credited Cook with ""making a 'good case' about how Apple would be impacted, but its rival Samsung would not. 'It's tough for Apple to pay tariffs if it's competing with a very good company that's not,'"" Trump said at the time. Trump and Cook also have appeared to maintain ties going into the 2024 election. Most recently, Trump claimed that he received a call from Cook over the financial penalties imposed on Apple by European regulators. During a podcast appearance last month, Trump said Cook called him personally. Trump said he told Cook: ""I'm not going to let them take advantage of our companies. ... That won't be happening."" Apple never confirmed that exchange and was not immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment Wednesday. However, Cook was among the tech executives to congratulate Trump in social media posts Wednesday. Bottom line Apple deftly navigated a first Trump term, but it's way too early to say with certainty what Trump's second term in office will mean for the California tech giant. Still, we're maintaining our ""own, don't trade"" thesis on this long-held portfolio stock. On the regulatory front, investors have largely been able to handle Apple's antitrust risk. While Apple shares fell 4.1% on the day the DOJ lawsuit was filed in March , the stock began to largely trend higher a few weeks later. As recently as October, shares of the iPhone maker hit a record high, and are up 16% since the start of 2024. To be sure, that doesn't mean a regulatory crackdown won't present challenges down the line. But it's too soon to worry as these cases typically years to play out. Plus, it can't hurt that Cook and Trump have seemingly maintained a solid business relationship for years. As for tariffs, Apple has wisely expanded its manufacturing capabilities outside of China in markets like India, and it should continue to do so. This will help diversify its supply chain to hedge against potential geopolitical risk. In Trump's second term, ""Apple is going to need what I call special pleading,"" Jim Cramer said during the Morning Meeting. ""They are going to have to go to the government and say, 'Look, we are going to have to move out of China into India. [But] it can't be done overnight.'"" ""They will get their special pleading because they're not regarded as a political company,"" Jim predicted. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN.

Nvidia shares rose Monday morning, boosting its market value to $3.38 trillion by the afternoon, surpassing Apple's $3.35 trillion market cap. The news came just days after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 30-member index that's often viewed as a key metric of the U.S. economy.

By Monday evening, Apple bounced back to the top with a $3.38 trillion market value, compared to Nvidia's $3.34 trillion.

Nvidia's dominant market position, driven largely by its development of powerful computer chips that can power artificial intelligence models, is lightyears from its roots as a 3D graphics company for video games. Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang and his two friends, engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, started the business in 1993 while eating at a Denny's restaurant in San Jose, California, Huang told CBS' ""60 Minutes."" in April.

Nvidia passed Apple in market cap on Tuesday becoming, for a second time, the most-valuable publicly traded company in the world.

Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close with a market cap of $3.43 trillion, ahead of Apple at $3.4 trillion. Nvidia shares have almost tripled in 2024, as investors show continued confidence in the company's ability to maintain a rapid growth rate from its graphics processing units (GPUs) and a leadership position in the artificial intelligence market.

Apple shares are up about 17% this year, although many analysts say the recent release of the Apple Intelligence suite of features for iPhones could drive increased sales and put the company in a leadership position in ""edge AI,"" which relies less on GPU-based servers.

Nvidia is the dominant supplier of GPUs, which are used to develop and deploy advanced AI software like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Its stock is now up more than 2,700% in the last five years, and revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, tripling in three of them.

Apple was the first company to reach a $1 trillion and a $2 trillion market cap. Nvidia previously passed Apple in June before sliding over the summer. Microsoft , ranked third with a market cap of close to $3.1 trillion, is a major customer of Nvidia GPUs to fuel its partnership with OpenAI as well as its own AI ambitions.

Founded in 1991 to produce chips for playing 3D games, Nvidia has taken off in recent years for a very different reason. In the past decade, scientists and researchers discovered that the same Nvidia chip designs that could render polygons and computer graphics were ideal for the kind of parallel processing needed for AI. Nvidia then developed software and more powerful chips specifically for AI.

Last week, Apple reported a 6% increase in revenue for the most recent quarter but signaled weaker growth than analysts expected in the current period. Nvidia is scheduled to report results on Nov. 20.

S&P Dow Jones announced on Friday that Nvidia will join the Dow Industrial Average on Friday, replacing long-time rival Intel , and joining Apple in the blue-chip index.

The Omaha-based conglomerate held $69.9 billion worth of Apple shares at the end of September, according to its third-quarter earnings report released Saturday morning. That implied Buffett offloaded approximately a quarter of his stake with about 300 million shares remaining in the holding. In total, the stake is down 67.2% from the end of the third quarter last year.

Warren Buffett sold another big chuck of his Apple stake, downsizing Berkshire Hathaway 's biggest equity holding for four quarters in a row.

It's unclear what exactly motivated the continuous selling in the stock Berkshire first bought more than eight years ago. Analysts and shareholders had speculated it was due to high valuations as well as portfolio management to reduce concentration. Berkshire's Apple holding was once so big that it took up half of its equity portfolio.

In May at the Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett hinted that the selling was for tax reasons as he speculated that the tax on capital gains could be raised in the future by a U.S. government wanting to plug a climbing fiscal deficit. However, the magnitude of the sales made many believe it could be more than just a tax-saving move.

Berkshire began buying the stock in 2016 under the influence of Buffett's investing lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Before Apple, Buffett largely avoided technology companies for most of his career, saying they were outside of his circle of competence.

The legendary investor fell in love with Apple for its loyal customer base and the stickiness of the iPhone. Over the years, he raised his Apple holding to Berkshire's biggest and even once called the tech giant the second-most important business after his cluster of insurers.

Apple will buy Pixelmator, the creator of image editing apps for Apple's iPhone and Mac platforms, Pixelmator announced Friday in a blog post.

Pixelmator, a Lithuanian company, was founded in 2007, and in recent years has been best known for Pixelmator and Pixelmator Pro, which compete with Adobe Photoshop. It also makes Photomator, a photo editing app.

Apple has highlighted Pixelmator apps over the years in its keynote product launches. In 2018, Apple named Pixelmator Pro its Mac App of the year, citing the company's enthusiastic embrace of Apple's machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, such as removing distracting objects from photos or making automated color adjustments.

""We've been inspired by Apple since day one, crafting our products with the same razor-sharp focus on design, ease of use, and performance,"" Pixelmator said in its blog post.

Apple does not acquire as many large companies as its Silicon Valley rivals. It prefers to make smaller acquisitions of companies with products or people that it can use to create Apple features. Neither Pixelmator nor Apple provided a price for the transaction.

Pixelmator said in its blog post that there ""will be no material changes to the Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps at this time.""

Earlier this week, Apple released the first version of Apple Intelligence, a suite of features that includes photo editing abilities such as Clean Up, which can remove people or objects from photos using AI.

Apple has acquired other popular apps that received accolades at the company's product launches and awards ceremonies.

In 2020, Apple bought Dark Sky, a weather app that eventually became integrated into Apple's default weather app. In 2017, it bought Workflow, an automation and macro app that eventually became Shortcuts, the iPhone's scripting app, as well as the groundwork for a more capable Siri assistant."

It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty darn good. Revenue in Apple's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which ended in September, grew 6% year-over-year to a September quarter record of $94.93 billion – outpacing the LSEG estimate of $94.58 billion. Adjusted earnings per share advanced 12% to $1.64 –edging out LSEG's estimate of $1.60. It's worth noting that Apple usually doesn't report on an adjusted basis, however, due to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion resulting from the reversal of the European General Court's state aid decision, the company opted to provide a reconciliation of this and report the adjusted result, which is what Wall Street will grade the quarter on. Apple Why we own it: Apple's dominant hardware and growing services businesses provide a deep competitive moat and plenty of bundling opportunities. Management's net cash neutral strategy provides confidence that free cash flow will continue to fund dividends and buybacks. There's a reason it's one of only two ""own it, don't trade it"" stocks in the portfolio. Competitors: Samsung, Xiaomi, OPPO, Dell and HP Inc. Most recent buy : April 8, 2014 Initiation : Dec. 2, 2013 Bottom line We are once again reminded why it doesn't pay to try to game Apple's quarterly release. For all the fear-mongering we have had to contend with over the past few weeks about just how horrendous this print was going to be, it ended up being a September quarter sales record for the world's greatest consumer technology company. On the post-earnings call, outgoing CFO Luca Maestri said, ""We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific."" Americas rose 3.9% to $41.66 billion, a tad below estimates. Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific grew and beat expectations. Rest of Asia Pacific is an Apple geographic designation for the region outside Japan and Greater China. Japan grew and beat in the quarter, while Greater China fell 0.3% to $15.03 billion, coming up nearly $1 billion short of expectations. As always, we were pleased to hear that Apple's installed base of active devices reached yet another all-time high across all products and geographic segments. This is a far more important factor than how many devices are sold in a given quarter. The key to Apple's success isn't how many devices it can sell in a three-month period but rather how well it does at increasing the lifetime value of its customers over time. Once Apple sells a device to someone new to the product suite it sets them up to sell more first-time items – it likely starts with an iPhone but half or more of Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch buyers in the quarter were new to the platforms. But that's just the start of drawing them ever deeper into the ecosystem, and the deeper you get, the higher the switching costs become. We expect that to be even more true going forward as Apple Intelligence is further built out – more features will be added in December. While the hardware sales are certainly profitable, they pale in comparison to the profitability of Apple's Services. They are however the gateway through which those Services are sold, so a growing installed base is a very important sign of future earnings growth. Regarding interest in Apple Intelligence, the company's answer to AI, we believe it will boost the iPhone upgrade cycle over time. Since the AI features were just released in an operating system update, the data so far is limited. The team did note, however, on the call that in the first three days of iOS 18.1 being launched adoption rates have been twice as fast as what we saw for the iOS 17.1 release. It's early but clearly users are excited about what Apple Intelligence will mean for the iPhone and eager to try it out. AAPL YTD mountain Apple's year-to-date stock performance. Yes, Apple shares were down nearly 2% in after-hours following a similar decline in Thursday's rough regular session for tech stocks. But we think these results, once again, demonstrate that there is a whole heck of a lot more money to be made over the long-term by owning Apple stock, rather than trying to jump out every three months to try to avoid the next pullback and time the jump back before the next rally. It's impossible to do consistently, and that's why Jim Cramer always says ""own, don't trade"" Apple stock. While maintaining our wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating for the time being, we're increasing our price target to $250 per share from $240 as we look ahead to Apple's next fiscal year, which we believe will be a very exciting one as Apple Intelligence, in the words of CEO Time Cook, ""marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation,"" and represents the ""beginning a new era for iPhone."" Our new price target implies 10.7% upside from Thursday's close. Commentary On a companywide basis, cost of sales and SG & A (selling, general and administrative) expenses were a bit high but that's to be expected when sales outpace expectations. More importantly, Apple's overall gross margin and its operating income margin were both stronger than expected. Mac, iPad, Wearables, and Services sales were all a bit short, but within two percentage points of expectations, and were more than offset by the strength in iPhones. Moreover, gross income outpaced expectations for both the overall Products category as well as the Services segment. Product gross margin was a hair short of expectations, however, was more than offset by a very strong gross margin in Services. While overall cash flow came in a bit short, it does mark a September quarter record for operating cash flow. Apple has a policy of being net cash neutral over time, meaning that if the cash isn't used for acquisitions or organic growth investments, it is returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the reported quarter, Apple returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and another $25 billion via the repurchase of 112 million shares. The company exited its fiscal Q4 with roughly $157 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet. After subtracting $107 billion of debt, we're left with a net cash position of about $50 billion. Products On the call, Maestri said something that was music to our ears: ""Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products."" iPhone sales achieved a September quarter record and achieved an all-time high installed base in every geographic segment, with the CFO noting that according to survey work from Kantar, the ""iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Australia and Japan."" Services The segment hit an all-time quarterly revenue record. Though Services sales missed the mark, gross income managed to outpace expectations thanks to significant year-over-year margin expansion. ""We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching records in both developed and emerging markets, with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories,"" noted Maestri. The growing installed base of active devices is of course translating into strong engagement with Apple's services. The CFO said, ""Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew by double digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago."" Guidance December quarter (fiscal 2025 first quarter) guidance assumes no worsening of the macroeconomic outlook. Total revenue in fiscal Q1 is expected to increase grow at a low-to-mid-single digit rate – the Street was looking for 7% year-over-year top-line growth. Services revenue is expected to increase at a double-digit rate in line with what we saw for fiscal 2024, which was about 12%, right in line with expectations. Gross margin is projected to be between 46% and 47%, better than the 46.1% estimate, at the midpoint. Operating expenses are forecast in a range of $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion, a bit higher than the $15.32 billion estimate. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL.

Apple's second-largest division after the iPhone has turned into a $100 billion a year business that Wall Street loves.

In Apple's earnings report on Thursday, the company said it reached just under $25 billion in services revenue, an all-time high for the category, and 12% growth on an annual basis.

""It's an important milestone,"" Apple CFO Luca Maestri said on a call with analysts. ""We've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago and the the growth has been phenomenal.""

Apple first broke out its services revenue in the December quarter of 2014. At the time, it was $4.8 billion.

Apple's services unit has become a critical part of Apple's appeal to investors over the past decade. Its gross margin was 74% in the September quarter compared to Apple's overall margin of 46.2%.

Services contains a wide range of different offerings. According to the company's SEC filings, it includes advertising, search licensing revenue from Google, warranties called AppleCare, cloud subscription services such as iCloud, content subscriptions such as the company's Apple TV+ service, and payments from Apple Pay and AppleCare.

On a January 2016 earnings call, when the reporting segment was relatively new, Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors to pay attention.

""I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge, and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on,"" Cook said.

Over the years, Apple has compared its services business to the size of Fortune 500 companies, which are ranked by sales, to give a sense of its scale. After Thursday, Apple's services business alone, based on its most recent run rate, would land around 40th on the Fortune 500, topping Morgan Stanley and Johnson & Johnson.

Services appeals to investors because many of the subscriptions contained in it are billed on a recurring basis. That can be more reliably modeled than hardware sales, which will increase or decrease based on a given iPhone model's demand.

""Yes, the the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one,"" Maestri said on Thursday.

Apple's fourth-quarter results beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings on Thursday, but net income slumped after a one-time charge as part of a tax decision in Europe. The stock fell as much as 2% in extended trading."

Apple reports fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday. It's the end of Apple's fiscal year, and it's the first quarter with sales from the September launch of the iPhone 16.

Here's what to expect, according to LSEG consensus estimates:

Earnings per share : $1.53

: $1.53 Revenue: $94.46 billion

The most critical item will be what Apple signals to investors about its December quarter, which is its largest seasonal sales period of the year. That will set the tone about the current iPhone sales cycle and whether it represents a chance for revenue growth driven by the launch of Apple Intelligence.

Apple doesn't provide official guidance, but it typically offers forecast data points on a call with analysts that suggest whether the company expects sales growth and how some of its product lines might fare — especially the iPhone, which still accounts for a majority of Apple's sales.

Without Apple's official guidance and sales, investors parse surveys and shipping dates on Apple's website to get a clue.

Some analysts are pointing to signs so far as ""mixed.""

""To be clear, we have not heard of any iPhone build cuts in our checks, but after a month of tracking iPhone 16 demand indicators, we'd characterize iPhone demand as mixed,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a note Oct. 22.

Other analysts are watching for when exactly Apple Intelligence will start to boost sales. Apple Intelligence is rolling out in pieces over the next few months. It's available in American English now, but will add support for German, Italian, Korean, Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish next year, Apple says.

""While iPhone sales will be on everybody's mind when AAPL reports, the stream of data points indicates that there is little reason to believe an upgrade cycle has started,"" wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in a note this week. ""That should be expected, as Apple Intelligence features (the only reason to upgrade)

have yet to be rolled out in a significant way.""

U.S. carriers, including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, have also seemed unexcited about an Apple Intelligence upgrade cycle.

""We're still waiting, obviously, for the software release and whether or not that software release drives interest in the consumer base,"" AT&T CEO John Stankey said on an earnings call last week.

Sales in greater China were one of the weakest parts of Apple's most recent quarterly report, declining 6% in the face of increased pressure from Chinese rivals.

""We believe even with new iPhone launch, Apple still faces pressure from Huawei, and we don't expect the competition to ease any time soon,"" Citi analyst Malif Atik wrote in a note this week.

But research firm Counterpoint Research told CNBC in October that iPhone sales, especially for the lower-priced devices, were strong in China.

""We're seeing strong iPhone 16 series unit sales in China, up 20% compared to iPhone 15 series during its first three weeks of sales last year,"" a Counterpoint representative said.

Investors will also look closely at Apple's ""wearables"" category, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones. Both of those product lines saw new models hit store shelves during the quarter, including Apple Watches with bigger screens and low-end AirPods with noise canceling.

The new products could reverse the trend of Apple's wearables sales declining on a year-over-year basis for four straight quarters.

Overall, analysts polled by LSEG expect about 5.6% revenue growth on an annual basis to about $95 billion in revenue.

That's in line with what Apple signaled in August. Apple also said at the time that its services unit — the company's catch-all, high-margin unit that includes everything from Major League Soccer subscriptions to Google search deals and extended iPhone warranties — would rise about 14% during the quarter, continuing its steady growth.

Thursday's report will also likely be the last with CFO Luca Maestri. Apple said in August that Maestri will step down Jan. 1 and be replaced by longtime lieutenant Kevan Parekh. Maestri won't be leaving Apple, though, and will retain oversight of some teams focusing on IT, real estate, and security.

Apple on Wednesday introduced new MacBook Pro laptops with updated processors, in what is likely the company's last major hardware announcement of the year.

The new devices are equipped with Apple's latest chip, the M4. Some models have access to more powerful versions, called the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Apple says the new chips are 1.8 times faster than the M1, which powered Apple's 2021 MacBook Pro.

Apple has also made a significant change across its entire Mac lineup to prepare the computers for future artificial intelligence features.

Apple said the new models, like all devices released this year, are designed for Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system that can generate text, images and emojis.

Additionally, all of the new MacBook Pro models come with at least 16GB of RAM. Until now, low-end Macs often came with 8GB of RAM by default. The more memory a computer has, the more it is capable of handling larger and more sophisticated AI models.

Apple's MacBook Air laptops and iMac desktops are also getting an update to start with at least 16GB of RAM at the same $999 starting price as before. The M4 also has improved AI capabilities.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer's volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple's latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple's least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple's highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple's lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple's laptops.

Apple on Monday released iOS 18.1, an update that includes the company's artificial intelligence, called Apple Intelligence, for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 Pro. It also released software updates for iPad and Mac with Apple Intelligence. The release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on the feature launch to power its marketing campaign for the iPhone 16 lineup released last month. It is also Apple's answer to Wall Street's questions about its AI strategy. Apple has taken a different path with its device-based AI than its megacap rivals, which are focused on cloud-based AI systems powered by billions of dollars of Nvidia chips. Apple Intelligence is limited to start. The first wave of Apple Intelligence features includes writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, new features that can remove objects from photos and a feature that can summarize a stack of notifications into a single message.

Monday's release includes improvements to Siri, including a new look that makes the entire screen glow around the phone's edges. Siri can answer questions about Apple products, including troubleshooting, and has more natural voices. However, the update does not let Siri take actions inside of apps, which is expected in another update next year. Plus, another update with ChatGPT integration and image-generation abilities is also scheduled for later this year as part of iOS 18.2. Some investors believe Apple Intelligence could drive a major upgrade cycle and cement Apple as the leader in daily usage of cutting-edge AI. ""Given the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence, we expect iPhone demand to pick up post initial release of Apple Intelligence in late Oct,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in an Oct. 25 note.

Opt in

You need an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence. The service primarily uses the iPhone's chip, which is why it does not work on earlier phones, though some more complicated queries will be handled by Apple's servers. You also need to turn it on by asking for access to Apple Intelligence in the Settings app. Doing so puts users on a waitlist. Apple has not said how long the wait will take, but during beta tests over the summer, users typically received access within the same day. Your phone will then download large files — Apple's AI models — that Apple Intelligence needs to operate.

He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.

""Huge opportunity,"" he said. ""Just please remember, the first move's been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger.""

Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford . Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles.

Tuesday brings McDonald's earnings report, and Cramer said to expect ""a full airing of the e-coli situation,"" but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states.



Cramer predicts Royal Caribbean , Reddit and PayPal to all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance.

Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth's stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been ""rarely in a good way."" He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn't seem to prioritize what investors want to hear.



Cramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices will do well enough to take parts of Nvidia's business. Chipotle will report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol's left the helm to run Starbucks , and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock.

Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar and Eli Lilly . Cramer said he saw the former's machines all over Chevron's floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn't sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit.



Meta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn't too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding and DoorDash , will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report.

The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch, Cramer said ""we've seen this movie before"" with the company and the best strategy is to hold on.



Another moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck and Bristol-Myers , are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought.

On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he ""can't stress how important this number is."" He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day.



Cramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron's returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition, even as Exxon doesn't have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides."

Huawei trailed Apple in third place with 15.3% market share, IDC data showed. However, the company's smartphone shipments in China grew by 42% year-on-year, as it continues to stage a revival in the world's largest smartphone market.

Apple stood at second position by market share in the third quarter, according to International Data Corporation (IDC). The tech giant took a 15.6% slice of the Chinese market over the period, down from 16.1% in the third quarter of last year. The company's shipment growth to China flatlined year-on-year in the third quarter. Apple stood at second position by market share in the third quarter.

Apple rejoined the ranks of the top five smartphone vendors in the China in the third quarter, helped by the launch of the iPhone 16, data released on Friday showed — but its growth was still outpaced by domestic rival Huawei.

Apple and Huawei have been locked in an intense battle since the Chinese tech giant launched its new Mate 60 smartphone last year that contained a surprisingly advanced chip. Huawei has been battered over the last few years by U.S. sanctions that have restricted its access to advanced semiconductors, along with software. The measures have crippled its smartphone business.

The Mate 60 has led to a Huawei revival in its home market, and the company has since launched a number of new devices, including a so-called trifold phone, the Mate XT.

Huawei's resurgence has put intense pressure on Apple in China, one of its largest and most important markets. In the second quarter, Apple was knocked out of the top five ranking in China by market share.

""Huawei has staged an impressive comeback, recording four consecutive quarters of at least double-digit growth. The launch of the world's first tri-foldable phone is expected to further drive the foldable market development,"" IDC said in its report.

The Cupertino giant is hoping the iPhone 16 series will help it stage a comeback in China, with the company promising many new AI software features called Apple Intelligence. The company has said that Apple Intelligence will launch in the U.S. this fall, but there is no clear timeline as to when it will be released in China, mainly due to more complicated regulation in the country.

In the absence of Apple Intelligence, Chinese rivals including Oppo, Huawei and Honor have been touting their own AI features.

Apple CEO Tim Cook visited China this week, meeting with top government officials and executives at the country's tech companies. One analyst told CNBC this may be an attempt to shore up partnerships with Chinese companies to launch Apple Intelligence.

Domestic rival Vivo stood in first place with 18.6% of the Chinese market share in the third quarter and year-on-year shipment growth of 21.5%, IDC said. Xiaomi and Honor were in fourth and fifth place, respectively.

Separate numbers released on Friday by Canalys showed Apple's China shipments in the third quarter declined 6% year-on-year. Canalys said Apple was fifth place by market share in China. Meanwhile, the data company put Huawei in second place by market share, with 24% year-on-year growth in the third quarter of this year."

Following weeks of mixed commentary about iPhone 16 demand and ahead of Thursday's earnings, KeyBanc Capital Markets downgraded Apple stock to an underweight sell from a sector weight hold rating. The analysts, who cited concerns about sales of the new AI-enabled device, set a $200-per-share price target. That implies more than 13% downside from current levels, which are just off Monday's record-high close of $236.48. Jim Cramer scoffed at the call — warning Friday that investors who follow these sell recommendations will likely ""miss the next giant move"" in Apple stock. ""[Analysts] always want to be right for the next 8 points or 10 points,"" not the next 100 points, he added ""We want to be right for the [next] 100."" That's why Jim has found success sticking to his ""own it, don't trade it"" Apple mantra. Looking at how Apple has traded around major sell-equivalent calls over the past five years, the idea of jumping in and out of this stock is a perilous game. Starting with Atlantic Equities in January 2020 through KeyBanc's downgrade late Thursday, the long-term trajectory of Apple shares has been higher. Sure, there are bumps along the way. But if you are exiting Apple stock knowing you want to get back in at some point, you have to be right twice: on the timing of the sale and then on the timing of the repurchase. It's nearly impossible and why Jim doesn't play that game. The sell call issued by Barclays back in January, for example, was a decent one in hindsight — considering shares continued to decline well into 2024 on a slew of cautious Wall Street commentary . Apple shares eventually hit a 52-week low of $164 in mid-April. The window to catch that bottom or anything near it was open ever so briefly before the stock was off to the races again. Missing that April low even by a few weeks would have had you buying back in right where you sold it. Bottom line The safest and most profitable bet is to just stay long on Apple. If you believe that shares can keep going higher over the long haul, as the Club does, then follow Jim's ""own it, don't trade it"" strategy. It's served Jim and the Club well over the many years of running his Charitable Trust portfolio. To be sure, ""own it, don't trade it"" does not mean to never take profits or trim the position if it grows to be too large of a weighting your diversified holdings.

China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology met with the CEO in Beijing on Wednesday to discuss Apple's development in China, network data security and cloud services, according to a ministry statement.

During the conversation, the ministry said Cook signaled Apple's commitment to the country, promising to increase investment in the market and to grow alongside Chinese companies. He also met with the leaders of several local Chinese firms in the same day, including China Mobile Chairman Yang Jie, to discuss digital content and 5G product cooperation, according to local reports.

Ivan Lam, senior research analyst for Counterpoint Research, said the timing of the trip is significant, coming as local competitors are introducing updated operating systems that integrate AI and new flagship products.

""This trip seems notable now as the company could be looking to shore up collaboration with local players to launch Apple Intelligence in China,"" Lam said.

Le Xuan Chiew, Canalys' analyst focusing on Apple strategy research, said the roll out of Apple Intelligence in China was likely the main motivation for Cook's trip, as well as to ""bolster the importance of China to Apple's global strategy.""

The timeline for the introduction of Apple Intelligence in China remains ""uncertain"" and will depend largely on regulatory approvals, which could explain some of the messaging focus of his China trip, Chiew said.

This could be a problem for the company as the lack of Apple Intelligence on Chinese devices is expected to weaken the motivation for users to upgrade to the iPhone 16, he added.

Apple Intelligence is the company's artificial intelligence play, which aims to bring AI across its devices, with features such as an improved voice assistant and tools that automatically organize emails and transcribe and summarize audio recordings.

While the company has said Apple Intelligence will roll out in U.S. English this fall, it has been more quiet on plans for the product offering in China.

Cook often travels to China — Apple's largest overseas market — to launch products and factories, visit suppliers and meet with local officials. During his visit in March, he had been in Shanghai for the opening of a new retail store. He also visited Chengdu this time last year as Apple faced lackluster demand in the world's second largest economy.

During his current trip, Cook was photographed visiting the offices of the Chinese social media giant Weibo and meeting with its CEO in a post on his personal Weibo account. Weibo is one of the local app developers that has launched applications for Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which was released in the Chinese market in June.

Apple successfully launched the iPhone 16, its latest model in the series, in China this September, and the new phones got off to a strong start. Sales were up 20% in the first three weeks since launch, compared to the 2023 model, according to data from research firm Counterpoint.

But despite the successful product launch, overall iPhone unit sales, including older models, were down 2% year-over-year in China during the three-week period.

Apple has faced dwindling market share in China amid increased competition with local players and an increasing preference among Chinese consumers to pick domestically made goods.

The company saw its market share in the second quarter fall 5.7% year-over-year, according to Counterpoint.

After it made a splash with a surprise 5G model last year, Huawei, one of Apple's main competitors in China, launched competing handsets the same day the iPhone 16 went on sale.

""Huawei's recent resurgence in the high-end market, driven by its in-house chips and HarmonyOS ecosystem, has intensified the competitive landscape, making it harder for Apple to maintain its leadership position,"" said Canalys's Chiew.

Apple's Vision Pro could also face more competition in the market as Huawei is reportedly gearing up to launch its own competing headset as soon as next week.

""As a result, iPhone 16 production for 2H24 is now estimated at 84 million units,"" Kuo wrote , noting that his estimate is down from about 88 million units.

Kuo said most of the cuts impact the regular iPhone 16 instead of the iPhone 16 Pro models , which have nicer displays and better cameras and have been more popular with consumers.

Apple shares fell about 2% on Wednesday after industry supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the company has cut orders for the iPhone 16 by about 10 million units for the fourth quarter of this year and the first half of 2025.

Apple on Wednesday released a beta version of a slew of Apple Intelligence features, including its long-awaited ChatGPT integration. The company announced its answer to the AI boom this summer, but is slowly rolling out its features to users. Investors hope AI features will spur a wave of iPhone upgrades because the tools are only available on newer devices. Apple Intelligence has been available in previews for developers and early adopters, but the official public release will come next week as part of the official iOS 18.1 release, Apple said. This latest batch of features is included in a beta version of iOS 18.2 for software developers that was released on Wednesday. Apple developer betas typically go through a cycle of weeks before they are released to the public. The preview included with iOS 18.2 contains: New abilities to describe how the user wants Apple Intelligence to rewrite a chunk of text

Genmoji, Apple's image generator for new emojis

Image Playground, Apple's AI image generator

Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or distractions from photos

Integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT However, the long-awaited ability for Siri to take actions inside of apps isn't included in this update, but is expected soon.

Answers from ChatGPT

In June, Apple announced its integration with ChatGPT. Although Apple Intelligence and Siri mostly rely on Apple's chips inside its devices, the company said at the time that for more sophisticated problems or questions, users can get responses from OpenAI's chatbot instead.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Apple and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday to pay more than $89 million for mishandling consumer disputes related to Apple Card transactions.

The bureau said Apple failed to send tens of thousands of consumer disputes to Goldman Sachs. Even when Goldman Sachs did receive disputes, the CFPB said the bank did not follow federal requirements when investigating the cases.

Goldman Sachs was ordered to pay a $45 million civil penalty and $19.8 million in redress, while Apple was fined $25 million. The bureau also banned Goldman Sachs from launching new credit cards unless it can provide an adequate plan to comply with the law.

""Apple and Goldman Sachs illegally sidestepped their legal obligations for Apple Card borrowers. Big Tech companies and big Wall Street firms should not behave as if they are exempt from federal law,"" said CFPB director Rohit Chopra.

Apple Card was first launched in 2019 as a credit card alternative, hinged on Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment and digital wallet service. The company partnered with Goldman Sachs as its issuing bank, and advertised the card as more simple and transparent than other credit cards.

That December, the companies launched a new feature that allowed users to finance certain Apple devices with the card through interest-free monthly installments.

But the CFPB found that Apple and Goldman Sachs misled consumers about the interest-free payment plans for Apple devices. While many customers thought they would get automatic interest-free monthly payments when they bought Apple devices with an Apple Card, they were still charged interest. Goldman Sachs did not adequately communicate to consumers about how the refunds would work, which meant some people ended up paying additional interest charges, according to the CFPB.

It also meant some consumers had incorrect credit reports, the agency said.

""Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards that has ever been offered. We worked diligently to address certain technological and operational challenges that we experienced after launch and have already handled them with impacted customers,"" Nick Carcaterra, vice president of Goldman Sachs corporate communications, told CNBC. ""We are pleased to have reached a resolution with the CFPB and are proud to have developed such an innovative and award-winning product alongside Apple.""

Representatives from Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Pictured here is CEO George Zhao speaking in Shanghai on June 26, 2024.

The new HarmonyOS uses in-house AI to allow users to translate text, take notes and edit photos, according to the company. U.S. sanctions cut Huawei off from Google, prompting the Chinese company to launch its own operating system, HarmonyOS, in 2019. The newly released OS is reportedly a fully self-developed system and is not based on Android open source software.

Telecommunications giant Huawei on Tuesday launched an upgrade to its HarmonyOS system that eliminated reliance on the Google-created Android operating system.

Honor, a spinoff from Huawei that focuses on higher-end devices, revealed Wednesday the latest version of its Android-based Magic operating system would focus on AI as an assistant.

A company demo showed how even with a vague voice command — such as ""I'm tired, order something"" — the phone was able to automatically order coffee without requiring the user to touch the device. It used AI to mimic actions on a touchscreen. Human intervention was only needed to complete the payment.

The AI assistant could also identify documents and send them to contacts, or make calls via social media app WeChat, all without requiring the user to touch the phone.

For devices in China, Honor works with Baidu and other Chinese companies for some AI functions, while developing others on its own. Honor works with Google for devices sold overseas.

The new AI features are slated for release on Honor's forthcoming Magic 7 smartphone, due for launch on Oct. 30. Honor plans to roll out AI capabilities to all its devices by the first few months of next year.

The Magic 7 will use Qualcomm 's newly announced Snapdragon Elite 8 chip for phones. Honor on Monday had teased its new AI features at the chipmaker's annual event.

Chinese home appliance and smartphone company Xiaomi will also launch a new phone this month that uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon Elite 8 chip. Xiaomi has been less vocal about its AI features for smartphones.

The AI features have climbed to a new level, Toby Zhu, senior analyst, Canalys, said in a phone interview Wednesday after Honor's event. He said the new features have greater potential to convince consumers to switch to another device.

""Apple faces challenges in China but from our data it won't face a significant decline,"" he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC."

If you already own the headphones, the hearing health features are worth exploring. They take just a few minutes to set up, and they're easy to use from the comfort of your home. The AirPods Pro 2 are also a cost-effective option for those looking for assistive hearing technology. Other over-the-counter hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars without insurance, for instance.

More than 1.5 billion people are living with hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. Tapping into this market could help Apple juice sales for the $249 AirPods Pro 2, which the company first launched two years ago.

Apple unveiled the features during an event in September, and they will be publicly available through a free software update next week. Users can take a clinically validated hearing test with the AirPods Pro 2, and the buds will serve as an over-the-counter hearing aid if applicable. The headphones will also be equipped with new hearing protection capabilities, such as loud sound reduction, that are switched on by default.

I tested the new hearing health features coming to Apple 's AirPods Pro 2 headphones, and they saved me a long-overdue trip to the audiologist.

I have a pair of third-generation AirPods that I use every day, but this was my first time trying the AirPods Pro 2. I took them straight out of the box, flipped open the lid to the charging case and paired them with an iPhone. After that, I popped them in my ears and prepared to take Apple's hearing test.

During its event in September, Apple said 80% of adults in the U.S. have not had their hearing checked in the past five years. That's certainly true in my case. The last time I remember getting my hearing tested was in elementary school.

Admittedly, I haven't gone out of my way to protect my hearing, so I wasn't sure what my results would look like. I felt a little nervous beforehand.

To access the test, you can go into the Health app or into the earbuds' settings menu. I pulled it up, and it prompted me with a few basic questions about my age, my health and whether I'd been exposed to a loud environment in the past 24 hours.

You need to be in a very quiet space to take the test. Apple runs a background noise test to ensure your environment is suitable, and then it assesses the fit of your headphones within your ears. The AirPods Pro 2 come with medium-sized flexible ear tips attached, but there are extra small, small and large tip sizes included in the box. Apple sells a set of ear tips on its website for about $13 if you've misplaced yours.

I took the test in my apartment, and I didn't need to adjust the fit of the headphones. I read the test's instructions and then it was time to get started.

The hearing test plays a series of tones at different volumes and frequencies, and you tap the screen each time you hear a sound. It started with my left ear and moved to my right, and it took a little more than five minutes.

The hearing test was easy. There are some long pauses between tones, so I felt like I second-guessed myself occasionally. And Apple isn't kidding about finding a quiet space to take this test. Some of the tones were so soft that I practically had to hold my breath to hear them. My test also automatically paused a few times as traffic passed by outside, so I'd recommend finding a room that's as close to silent as possible.

You can take the test as many times as you want, and you'll get your results as soon as you're done. A copy is stored in the Health app, and you can share it with your doctor.

I learned that I have little to no hearing loss in both ears, though there are some frequencies that might be harder for me to pick up on. It's nice to have that peace of mind.

The news Sales of the new AI-enabled iPhone 16 in China jumped 20% in the first three weeks since going on sale there, according to Counterpoint Research data released Friday. That compares to the same post-launch period in 2023. The new Pro and Pro Max were particularly strong there. Apple's iPhone 16 models and the latest high-end smartphones from Chinese rival Huawei both hit stores in China on the same day, Sept. 20. The two are fierce rivals in China — so much so their flagship stores in Shanghai are right across the street from each other. Big picture The Counterpoint data is the second positive iPhone report this week after a recent slew of mixed Wall Street analysts' commentary expressing concerns about early sales of the new device. Club stock Apple hit an all-time intraday high on Tuesday following a report from IDC signaling iPhone shipments were running above Wall Street estimates for the current quarter. If shares close about $234.82 on Friday, that would take out Apple's July record close — before the Aug. 5 market meltdown. Apple stock was more than 3% this week. Bottom line ""These numbers are real numbers, and they're amazing,"" Jim said Friday, referring to the Counterpoint data. As a result, he predicted Apple stock will ""blow through a lot of levels here."" Jim still expects a robust iPhone 16 upgrade cycle but has acknowledged that it may be elongated. The software features of Apple Intelligence, the company's flavor of AI, were not released with the new operating system that usually comes shortly after iPhone launches. They are expected later this month. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

During the company's fiscal third quarter, Apple showed the strongest growth in its iPad segment, which grew about 24% year-over-year after it introduced several new iPads for the first time since 2022.

Shares hit an all-time high Tuesday despite a chorus of recent concerns from Wall Street analysts about demand for the new artificial intelligence-enabled iPhone 16. The news A major catalyst for Tuesday's move: Data that signaled strong demand for Apple's biggest money maker, the iPhone. In the third quarter, iPhone shipments rose 3.5% year over year to 56 million, according to a report Monday from market research firm International Data Corporation. That's well above the Wall Street consensus of 50 million shipments, implying potentially between $2 billion to $4 billion of revenue upside in the quarter, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients Tuesday. Apple's share of the global smartphone market in the quarter held roughly steady from the year-ago period at 17.7%, according to IDC. Apple is second to only electronics giant Samsung , which had 18.3% share. ""In Q3 2024, older iPhone models, specifically the iPhone 15, performed exceptionally well due to the heavy promotions and increased marketing activities around Apple Intelligence,"" Nabila Popal, research director for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a release. Apple Intelligence is the company's new suite of generative artificial intelligence tools due out later this month. ""Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season as it expects many customers to upgrade from the iPhone 13, iPhone 12 and prior models to a new AI-enabled smartphone, future-proofing their purchases for the long term,"" Popal continued. The IDC report helped propel shares of Apple to an all-time intraday high of $237.49 apiece Tuesday, narrowly eclipsing their previous peak reached in July. While the stock is off its highs of the session, it remains up around 2% and on track for its loftiest close on record. Its current record close of $234.82 was set on July 16. Apple has rebounded nicely from Wall Street's early August swoon , though the stock still entered Tuesday slightly underperforming the S & P 500 since the index's recent bottom on Aug. 5. Also Tuesday, Apple announced its first update to the iPad mini in three years . Available for preorder now, the tablet has a processor capable of supporting Apple Intelligence. Big picture The IDC data comes as many on Wall Street express skepticism around sales for the new iPhone 16 lineup. A number of analysts, including from JPMorgan, Barclays and Bank of America, all previously said lower shipping times for the latest iPhone models may indicate softer demand for the AI-capable devices. To be sure, not all chatter around the tech giant is negative. Evercore ISI listed Apple as a tactical outperform on Sunday ahead of its earnings report in late October. Analysts at the firm said Apple shares can rally if the company merely meets investors' rather low expectations for the quarter. Apple's advance Tuesday — paired with a pullback in fellow Club holding Nvidia amid broader weakness in chip stocks — means the company should retain the crown of most valuable publicly traded U.S. company for at least another day. Nvidia closed Monday at a record high, putting its market cap at $3.4 trillion . Apple's stood at $3.55 trillion. Bottom line Investors are right to be focusing on the upbeat IDC data, which is ""very contrary to what most of Wall Street is thinking,"" Jim Cramer said Tuesday. Although Apple is trading at record levels Tuesday, more upside should be ahead for the stock as an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle plays out over time, boosting sales. Jim on Tuesday maintained his long-held ""own it, don't trade it"" thesis on Apple stock. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, NVDA. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Apple could launch a connected ring to rival Samsung by 2026, according to CCS Insight, adding to the U.S. tech giant's focus on health. The call is part of CCS Insight's annual predictions report and if it came true, it would be the first new product from the Cupertino giant since the Apple Vision Pro headset launched this year. ""Health has become a fundamental pillar for Apple. In fact, I would go so far as to say, at the point that Tim Cook decides to relinquish control and he retires ... I would like to think that one of his major legacies from Apple would be around personal health,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC's Beyond the Valley podcast published on Tuesday.

""Given how deeply and personally invested Tim Cook is in health, I think that a ring is a very complimentary extension to Apple,"" he said, referring to Apple CEO Cook. Wood highlighted Apple's focus on health from products like the Apple Watch with all of its sensors to the latest AirPods Pro 2 headphones that can turn into hearing aids. Similar to smartwatches, a smart ring is embedded with various sensors to track health metrics like heart rate. Oura was one of the pioneers of the space, but Samsung this year launched the Galaxy Ring, bringing this style of product to a bigger audience, as it looks to make a bigger push into the health space. The Samsung Galaxy Ring costs $399 and adds to the South Korean tech giant's portfolio of products from smartphones to smartwatches as it looks to keep users locked into its world of devices."

Some can get spooked by analyst downgrades, for example, and sell their position in a great company that will be hard to later buy back.

""In the last decade, the toughest thing to do is to hold on to good stocks,"" he said. ""But analysts and commentators love to take aim at big long-term winners. Their jeremiads have scared so many people out of some amazing gains.""

According to Cramer, many on Wall Street can be ""complacent,"" with bulls ignoring downside risks and bears ignoring opportunities. If investors want to take action on a downgrade, it's wise to wait for a bounce to sell. Then, buy back at a lower price, but that is ""incredibly hard"" to achieve, even for talented traders, he said.

Cramer recapped action in the stocks of Apple and Amazon , which received downgrades on Monday — ratings with which Cramer disagreed. Analysts were bearish on Apple in part because of perceived hardware issues with the newest iPhone model, but Cramer countered that the company's products have been continuously popular. He also acknowledged that Amazon may be facing some headwinds, but the megacap has a steady track record of bouncing back.

Both stocks sold off heavily on Monday, he pointed out, but they recovered by Tuesday — hampering investors' chances of buying back shares if they sold during the previous session.

""When I look at the history of this incredible bull market—and it has been an incredible bull market—it's littered with 'buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell, buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell,' these downgrades that scare you out of amazing stocks at levels that may temporarily be too high, but will recover later,"" he said. ""If you listen to the downgrades, though, you'll never recover with it.""

Cramer said Monday had a ""ridiculous plethora of sell-side downgrades,"" where the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.94%, the S&P 500 shed 0.96% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.18%. He conceded that the session was poor, but said heeding too many downgrades can be bad for those investing in the market for the long term.

Although he acknowledged that Amazon is facing some hurdles, he disagreed with Wells Fargo's downgrade of the stock. He said the megacap has faced hurdles before and bounces back, saying it's only a matter of time before that happens. He noted that shares recovered after a substantial dip at the beginning of August, when the company reported a revenue miss.

Cramer also disagreed with Jeffries' downgrade of Apple . While he said the company could be facing some near-term headwinds with the release of the iPhone16, he claimed the company doesn't have a record of releasing subpar products. He continued, sayin the downgrade was ""betting against Apple's entire culture of excellence.""

As Apple prepares Apple Intelligence to jump into Silicon Valley's AI race, it's relying on one of its strongest advantages: Its army of 34 million app developers.

IPhone users will get their first taste of Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system, later this month. The company is relying on Apple Intelligence to be the strongest selling point for the iPhone 16, its latest generation of smartphones.

Apple's AI isn't as advanced as the state of the art coming out of the most advanced labs, such as rivals like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama. Apple isn't using the biggest models, nor can it pull off some of the more show-stopping tricks of the bleeding-edge voice models — OpenAI's latest can sing, for example.

Where Apple is hoping to distinguish its AI is that Siri may actually be able to do things on your phone — send emails, decipher calendars and take and edit photos. That's something other company's AI chatbots cannot currently do, and to accomplish this, Apple is beckoning its army of third-party developers to fine tune their apps to collaborate with Apple Intelligence. Eventually, Siri may be able to trigger any action in an app that a user can take, part of the company's long term vision for Siri, Apple said in June.

""Siri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions in and across apps,"" said Apple's Kelsey Peterson, director of machine learning, in the Apple Intelligence launch video.

Apple can easily make this happen for its own apps, but for Apple Intelligence to interact with the millions of non-Apple apps, it needs developers to embrace a new way of programming their apps. This means developers will need to create as many as hundreds of snippets of additional code called App Intents.

Apple has a strong history of getting its developers to support new platform initiatives, and it's running a well-worn playbook to get them on board — personal attention from developer relations, a party-like atmosphere at the company's annual developer's conference and most importantly, it dangles App Store promotion that can lead to millions of downloads for developers who get on board.

If third-party developers jump on board and the Siri system works as advertised, it could represent one of Apple's biggest and most durable advantages in the AI race.

""You should be able to string things together and kind of get that future we've all been envisioning where you can use Siri conversationally, to do a bunch of things at once,"" said Jordan Morgan, an iOS developer who's written a tutorial about App Intents.

Whether Apple is successful at cajoling its millions of developers is a critical question, and the stakes are high for the company.

The company is relying on Apple Intelligence, which only works on last year's iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 models that came out this year, to spur a wave of upgrades and boost flat iPhone sales. If Apple's improved Siri is poorly supported by developers or it fails to impress, it could cool iPhone sales, and customers could wind up choosing to use a rival's voice assistant through an app instead of the built-in Siri."

In a bumper pre-election budget speech, Irish Finance Minister Jack Chambers said the recent judgement from Europe's top court had provided the country with one-off revenue ""that has the capacity to be transformational.""

Chambers said Ireland's future economic performance would depend on how the country's infrastructure program is prioritized and delivered over the next decade, adding it is ""imperative"" not the use the cash injection ""for day-to-day expenditure or to narrow the tax base.""

""It is this government's view that we should utilize these revenues to address the known challenges that we face in housing, energy, water and transport infrastructure,"" Chambers said.

His comments come three weeks after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled against Apple over its tax affairs in Ireland. The landmark decision, which the court said was final, said Apple must pay Ireland billions of euros in back taxes.

The ECJ's ruling was welcomed by tax justice advocates, as well as the bloc's outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, who described the pronouncement as a ""huge win"" for European citizens.

Apple said at the time that it was disappointed with the decision, while the Irish government said that its position had always been that it ""does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers."""

It's scammers trying to convince you to call them and divulge sensitive information, which may include passwords, bank or credit account information or Social Security numbers.

""They use the reputation of the brand [for legitimacy purposes] to make it seem more real,"" said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at The National Cybersecurity Alliance. ""Because, who doesn't know Microsoft or Apple as a brand?""

Consumers are likely to see more of these types of scams now, in the wake of Apple's recent release of its new iPhone. There tends to be a rise in scams when a new product or version is released because it's easier for scammers taking advantage of news headlines to strike while the iron is hot, said Nati Tal, head of Guardio Labs, which identifies, monitors and mitigates internet security threats. ""In a very small time period, they will get tons and tons of potential victims.""

The scams can affect anyone, but as has been the case with other recent tech-linked consumer crime waves, such as bitcoin ATM fraud, the elderly are especially vulnerable. Last year, nearly 18,000 victims aged 60 and over reported tech support scams to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, making it the most widely reported kind of elder fraud in 2023. Fraud losses from tech support scams against the elderly amounted to $590 million of losses — and that's only reported cases.

These types of scams are getting even harder to spot because of AI, especially when the scheme uses a known company logo to make it look legit. Here's what people should know to protect themselves from scams targeting commonly used, trusted tech brands:

Never assume any online ad is authentic

People can be duped in a number of ways. One way is malvertising, in which bad actors pay for ads on search engines like Google or Microsoft's Bing. These rogue ads can appear as sponsored content, or in small print as an ad, during a search engine query.

So, for example, a consumer searching for ""Microsoft support"" might be shown a fake Microsoft ad with a number to call. By calling this number, people are playing right into scammers' hands, according to Malwarebytes, which has identified a number of these schemes. Malwarebytes also uncovered a malicious ad campaign targeting Mac users looking for support or extended warranty from Apple.

""People have all sorts of issues with their computers and they look for help, but a lot of the time the numbers they find will be a scammer's number, not the real one,"" said Jérôme Segura, senior director of research at Malwarebytes.

Pop-ups, emails from brands you know are often suspect

Tech scams also ensnare unsuspecting consumers through phishing emails for renewal offers that seem to come from legit places, including Microsoft, McAfee, PayPal and Norton. These emails could be laced with malware if users click on a link, or they could be phishing attempts to get more information from the individual. Sometimes simply opening the attachment could infect a consumer's computer with malware.

The other type of tech-support scam happens when a window pops up on a user's computer to warn of an ""infection.""

There's often audio associated with this type of scam to instill a sense of urgency for consumers to call the number listed in the pop-up. There may also be a button that says ""return to safety,"" but when clicked, what was a regular browser window — with the address bar and window title visible — becomes a full-screen page, with a message about not rebooting the computer because it's infected, Segura said.

""Imagine being the user and hearing the non-stop audio playing in the background saying your computer is compromised. This is very stressful and it will lead people to make a bad decision in calling the fake phone number,"" he said.

Once people call, they often are manipulated into sharing personal information such as their credit card number or giving scammers access to their computer.

How to click without getting into online trouble

For starters, consumers should avoid clicking on sponsored ads obtained during a Google or Bing query. (Hint: These often appear at the top of the search results page, but they can also appear further down, so look out for the word ""sponsored"" or ""ad"" depending on the search engine.) Consumers should also avoid clicking on random links sent in an email, even if they think they know the sender. And don't open attachments unless you're sure you know what's being sent.

In the case of a pop-up warning of a computer virus, Segura said the general rule is to only click on the browser's own icons which are typically at the very top right corner. ""Never click on any other 'X' within the web page itself, as it is fake,"" he said.

If people do click on the X or have clicked on ""return to safety,"" the webpage will likely go into full-screen mode. ""If that happens, you must first exit out of full screen by long pressing on the keyboard's escape button (Esc) and only then can you finally X out,"" Segura said.

Internet browsers come with basic protections, so be sure to keep your browsers updated. You might also want to install a free, or paid-protection service that covers multiple types of threats.

What to do if you fall for a tech scam

Next steps depend on the type of information you shared with scammers. If, for instance, you called a number for ""Microsoft"" or ""Apple"" and gave usernames and passwords, change those. If you only shared your name, address and phone number, it's not necessary to do anything because this information is readily available to scammers through data brokers, Jim Routh, chief trust officer at identity security company Saviynt, explained in an email.

Consumers who share their credit card number, expiration date and CVV, should call their credit card company's fraud line to report the incident and request a new credit card be overnighted.

If credentials are shared with the fraudster for other online accounts, the password for each should be immediately changed. It's also advisable for consumers to freeze their credit with each of the three primary credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This is a good practice to do for your whole family and especially for children under 18, even in the absence of a particular threat. It's also advisable to place a fraud alert with one of the credit bureaus, which will relay the information to all three.

People who are concerned they installed malware who don't have anti-virus protection should choose a reputable brand and install it, Routh said. If they lack technical sophistication, they can call the Geek Squad or a similar service to scan the workstation and find the malware to remove. Consumers who have given remote computer access to scammers should bring their device to a service professional for assistance, he added."

Apple on Friday greeted customers at its stores around the world for the debuts of the iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4. The new products were announced at an event earlier this month and have been available for pre-order since Sept. 13. The company lit up the glass cube at its Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City, in a nod to the enhanced Siri, which will light up the borders of the new iPhone's screen when that feature rolls out next month. Apple's latest iPhones mark the company's latest move into artificial intelligence, with new Apple Intelligence features that will begin to launch in October. The new features will allow customers to rewrite text, remove objects from photos and speak with an improved Siri. The software advancements will only be available on iPhone 16 and last year's iPhone 15 Pro devices.

But Apple shares slid on Monday after analyst reports suggested that demand for the latest iPhones was lower than expected. TF Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note on Monday that first-weekend sales were down about 12% year-over-year from the iPhone 15 last year. Barclays, JPMorgan and Bank of America also noted shipping times could translate to lighter demand for the more expensive iPhone Pro models compared to last year. On Friday, UBS analysts suggested investors shouldn't overreact to what appears to be lighter sales because that data is also collected by analyzing the wait times for new iPhone models and that those were longer last year due in part to supply chain disruptions. ""Ahead of the iPhone 16 announcement, our analysis suggested that a lack of a killer app and arguably somewhat half-baked introduction of Apple Intelligence would dampen demand,"" the UBS analysts wrote. ""While we still argue the collection of iPhone/iOS attributes are more evolutionary than revolutionary, we caution that investors not overreact to data that suggests somewhat initial tepid demand."" The UBS analysts said supply chain disruptions last year ""slightly distorted/extended last year's data,"" which led to longer wait times for customers for Pro models. Last year, UBS wrote, customers had a 41-day wait time for some iPhone 15 Pro Max preorders compared to a 26-day wait time for the iPhone 16 Pro Max this year. ""Nevertheless, data across all models and regions roughly a week post launch support our view that a super-cycle is not imminent as US and China data on the margin is disappointing relative to last year,"" they wrote.

BEIJING — Many of Apple 's affluent iPhone users in China are just as interested in Huawei's pricier trifold phone, CNBC found during spot checks at stores Friday, the day the iPhone 16 and Mate XT launched in the country. Out of 10 people CNBC talked to on Friday, eight said they are interested in both the new Huawei and Apple phones. CNBC talked to five individuals at each company's store during a workday morning. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has sought to rebuild its smartphone business after U.S. sanctions in 2019. Huawei ranked fourth by China smartphone market share in the second quarter, according to Canalys. U.S.-based Apple dropped out of the top five, giving domestic players the top five spots for the first time, the data showed. The iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199, and the iPhone 16 at $799. Huawei's trifold Mate XT starts at the equivalent of more than $2,800.

Wall Street analysts have been debating whether demand for the company's new artificial intelligence-ready iPhone models is off to a slow start ahead of Friday's rollout to stores. Jim Cramer said Thursday, however, there should be no debate after what T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert told him in a Wednesday interview for ""Mad Money."" The leader of one of the largest U.S. carriers said there have been more iPhone 16 sales in the first week of preordering compared to the same period last year for the iPhone 15. The iPhone 16 was announced on Sept. 9 , when the company held this year's fall new product event. ""People are buying Pros. They're buying Maxes. So, they're buying up the food chain, and they're buying at a greater rate,"" Sievert said, dismissing any softer iPhone 16 sales data as ""nonsense."" This is important because mobile carriers — including Verizon and AT & T — are the single-largest iPhone sales channel for Apple. These firms account for roughly 66% of iPhone shipments in the U.S., and about 40% worldwide, according to Morgan Stanley. That's why Jim trusts the T-Mobile CEO's word more than initial analyst channel checks on sales. ""Sievert stands for what the numbers really are,"" Jim stressed during Thursday's Morning Meeting . After listening to Sievert — who also spoke at Wednesday's T-Mobile analyst day — Morgan Stanley came to the same conclusion Jim did. In a Wednesday note, the Morgan Stanley analysts said the iPhone 16 will usher in a ""multi-year upgrade cycle"" for Apple because of its generative artificial intelligence capabilities. They said it's a ""when, not an if"" situation. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD This is a big pushback on Wall Street calls from earlier this week about softer demand for the iPhone 16 base and Pro models that knocked down Apple stock. Analysts from JPMorgan, Barclays and Bank of America said that lower shipping times compared to last year may indicate softer demand for the newest iPhone Pro models. TF Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, a noted Apple analyst, said that first-weekend sales for the iPhone 16 were down 12% year over year compared to the iPhone 15. Kuo said demand was lagging because a key selling point, the Apple Intelligence AI suite, won't be fully available until after the release. Sievert counted that notion, telling Jim on ""Mad Money"" that delays in the AI tools could drive more interest in the iPhone 16. ""I have a feeling the cycle will be lengthened a little. The AI features don't come out for a little while. That word-of-mouth of seeing Apple Intelligence on your phone and telling other people is still in front of us and will take a few weeks."" Shares of Apple were on a three-session winning streak, including Thursday's 3.8% surge. Year to date, Apple has gained 19% — roughly on par with the S & P 500 index's 20% increase in 2024.

iPhone 16 Pro Apple Inc.

Apple's iPhone 16 family of phones will hit shelves on Friday. Ahead of their launch, I've spent the past five days been testing the high-end iPhone 16 Pro Max. It's a great phone with cool updates like a dedicated camera button, and it charges faster over MagSafe than earlier Pro models. The screens are also slightly larger than prior versions. But this review is tricky, because one of the banner features Apple has been hyping — on stage and in its new ads — is Apple Intelligence. It's Apple's suite of AI features for the iPhone, and it's not coming until later this year. There are reasons to be excited. A few of the new AI features, like changes to Siri, photo editing, and the option to have AI rewrite text for you, will launch in beta in October. More additions, such as as Apple's image and emoji generator, more personal Siri responses and integration with ChatGPT, will come later. I was able to test some of the beta features for this review. Others weren't available. Those limitations make it difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment of the new device or to suggest whether the upgrade is worthwhile. Apple shares slid earlier in the week after analysts suggested lighter demand for the iPhone 16 Pro models this year. TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the problem is that Apple Intelligence isn't out at launch. Barclays also feared it may be because the Chinese language version of Apple Intelligence won't launch until 2025. Here's what you need to know about the new iPhone 16 Pro Max, as of now.

The changes to know about

iPhone 16 Pro. Apple Inc.

The biggest change you'll notice is the new camera button. I'm still getting used to it after a few days, but I'm already defaulting to just pulling the phone out of my pocket, tapping the button and taking a picture. My wife rightly asked me why I don't just hit the camera button on the lock screen like on earlier iPhones. I don't have a good answer for that. It just feels more natural to push a camera button. I enjoyed doing a half-press to get camera controls like the zoom during my son's first soccer game, though I found it was easier to sometimes just pinch to zoom. The new 48-megapixel wide-angle lens offers sharper images in zoomed-out shots that can capture more scenery. Videographers will likely enjoy the 4K 120fps recording offered on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Still, I try to keep my clips in lower quality because I'm sharing them over text messages with family and friends. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the best battery life of any iPhone yet. Apple's new A18 Pro processor paired with a larger battery offers up to 33 hours of video playback, up from 29 hours on last year's iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was usually able to make it to about dinnertime before needing to charge the 15, and I can make it to bedtime — or beyond — with the new phone depending on how much I'm using it. I love that Apple increased the speed of its MagSafe charging. I used MagSafe when it came out but ultimately switched back to regular cable charging because it was quicker. Now, MagSafe gives up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes if you're using a 30-watt charger (not included.) The screens are slightly larger on this year's Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro Max moved from 6.7 inches to 6.9 inches. I didn't notice a difference and could only tell when I put the two phones next to each other. It's still a fantastic screen with a high refresh rate, which means scrolling is smooth. It's colorful and bright and I love the always-on display for seeing notifications without picking up my phone. It's not new this year but still useful and limited to the Pro models.

Apple Intelligence

In the absence of Apple Intelligence at launch, I'm limited to testing a few beta features. They're hit or miss, as to be expected in beta. Apple Intelligence could help drive a new cycle of iPhone upgrades. Apple reported $39.3 billion in iPhone sales during the fiscal third quarter, about 46% of the company's total revenue and down 1% from a year earlier. CEO Tim Cook said the segment grew on a constant currency basis. I like email summaries provided by Apple Intelligence. They're accurate and give you just a couple of lines that summarize what's said or relayed in an email. This only works in Apple's Mail app, though, so it won't work if your company makes you use Outlook or if you prefer Gmail. Similarly, I found that Apple Intelligence accurately summarized long bits of text (including the introduction to this review) and returned an accurate snippet. In notifications, it's just OK. Summaries of news alerts were correct. Summaries of text messages sometimes were unnecessary. In one text from my wife, for example, Apple Intelligence suggested I threw a dinosaur at my daughter and made her cry before I apologized. In reality, my son was the culprit. The original text would have been sufficient. In a daycare app notification that I use, Apple Intelligence did a good job summarizing that my daughter ""took a nap, ate Cheerios, and is playing happily."" That would be a perfect amount of information to receive while driving.

Another Apple Intelligence feature can help you create movie memories, which are little snippets of photos and videos set to music. In a TV ad, Apple shows a young woman using it to create memories of a dead goldfish with the help of Siri. I couldn't use Siri to create movies like that. Instead, I opened the Photos app, tapped Memories and wrote in a prompt asking for a photo memory of my son ""learning to fish at Skytop set to a fishing tune."" It correctly showed pictures of a family trip to the Poconos but didn't include any pictures of my son fishing there. The music was called ""Fishing Tune"" by Jiang Jiaqiang but didn't sound like fishing music to me. Another test, asking for a photo memory of my son ""playing soccer,"" worked better but also included a picture of him as a baby with a football in his hands. There's also the whole new Siri interface that glows along the edges of the screen. I like the look compared to the globe, and it's easier to type to Siri by tapping the screen indicator at the bottom of the display. Siri doesn't feel drastically changed to me right now, although I liked that I could ask iPhone-specific questions like ""How do I use my iPhone to scan a document?"" and ""How do I take a screen recording?"" Siri presents the answer in a simple step-by-step guide at the top of the screen. You can speak to Siri with interruptions now, too. So, if you get stumped while you're thinking and say ""umm"" or ""hold on a second,"" you can continue to ask questions in the same line of thought, like ""How tall is the Eiffel Tower?"" and then follow with, ""And when was it built?"" But it doesn't always work. I tried ""How far is Boston?"" for example, followed by, ""And what's the weather there?"" Siri gave me the weather for my current location. Apple Intelligence can be useful and I'm excited to see where it goes.

Apple iPhone 16

I focused this review on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 is slightly smaller and has a little less battery life but is otherwise identical. My colleague used the regular iPhone 16. There are a few differences between the two. The iPhone 16 comes in more colors and is built out of aluminum instead of titanium like the higher-end Pro models. It also has the new camera button but lacks the higher refresh rate and the always-on features of the Pro model displays. The iPhone 16 will support all of the Apple Intelligence features I've mentioned above, plus the ones that are still coming. Apple also upgraded the processor for faster performance and added a new macro camera mode for up-close pictures of objects, as well as support for capturing spatial images for the Apple Vision Pro headset. It offers up to 22 hours of video playback versus the 20 hours in last year's iPhone 15.

Singapore — Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba 's Taobao shopping app topped the Apple App Store charts in Singapore after releasing an English version on Tuesday — thanks to translations powered by artificial intelligence. That's according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm whose data shows Taobao shot to first place in Apple's Singapore App Store across all categories, as of Sept. 11. On Tuesday, the day the English-language version was announced, the app rose from fifth to first place in the shopping category. Prior to this, the Taobao app had still enjoyed relative popularity and was consistently ranked in the top ten shopping apps for iPhone users from mid-August onwards, according to Sensor Tower. The new update ""highlights Taobao's dedication to serving its Singapore users, who have shown a strong desire for an English-language interface, reflecting their diverse language fluency,"" Alibaba said in a press release Tuesday. It did not elaborate on the AI translation features. The company has its own AI model. The release said the new platform ""enhances accessibility for non-Chinese users, eliminating their need for manual translations that previously made shopping less convenient for them.""

Taobao and Tmall are Alibaba's biggest source of revenue by far, but to date have primarily sold to people in China using a Chinese-language interface. Taobao and Tmall Group's revenue for the quarter ended June 30 was 26.55 billion yuan ($3.65 billion), a 6% increase year-on-year. Alibaba has in recent years has also sought to ramp up its overseas e-commerce business with platforms such as Alibaba.com and AliExpress. Singapore is the first market where Taobao will introduce this new update, alongside the city-state's neighbor, Malaysia, according to Alibaba. As early as last year, Singaporean Taobao users had previously made guides on how to purchase clothes, furniture and lifestyle items from Taobao. These video guides were posted on the ByteDance-owned TikTok platform, another Chinese app. Several videos amassed more than 10,000 views, with one accumulating 105,000 views. Alibaba's latest move reflects the growing trend of Chinese businesses striving to expand globally, and using Singapore as a cultural testbed to further their ambitions to reach the Western market. Last week, consulting firm Bain and Company said in their study of Asia Pacific-headquartered consumer goods companies that Chinese companies have a significant advantage versus South Korean and Japanese companies in the race to go global: the large ethnic Chinese diaspora settled outside of mainland China. ""There are many of these Chinese companies that have really ambitious global mindsets and are able to take the sort of entrepreneurial, fast-innovation capability that they built domestically and use that to create new positions overseas,"" David Zehner, senior partner at Bain, previously told CNBC. According to a government report as of end-June 2023, almost three-quarters of Singapore's 5.92 million-strong nation is of Chinese descent. About 20% of Malaysia's population is ethnically Chinese.

JD Vance on Thursday took a shot at Apple on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" saying he thinks the company benefits from ""slave labor"" in China. His comment was part of a broader conversation about taxing companies that rely on manufacturing in China.

""Do I think Apple is an evil company? No. Do I think that sometimes they benefit from Chinese slave labor? Yeah, and that's pretty sick,"" said Vance, of Ohio. ""I think that a company that wants to benefit from American markets should also have to pay American workers a fair wage."" Apple raised the starting wage for retail employees in May 2022 to $22 an hour.

Apple has previously said that it has found no evidence of forced labor anywhere it operates. The company had been asked by the former chairs of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China in 2021 to engage with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ensure its supply chain is free of forced labor.

Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The iPhone maker partners with manufacturers that build its devices overseas. Apple has historically relied on China for its production. As relations between the U.S. and China have become strained, it has worked to diversify its supply chain by expanding manufacturing to countries such as Vietnam and India.

For example, Apple produced $14 billion worth of iPhones in India over the last fiscal year.

Vance also said Thursday that he wants to raise tariffs on companies ""shipping jobs overseas."" Former President Donald Trump has threatened additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China and blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on imported goods.

Vance expressed support for Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan's antitrust crackdown and stricter rules on mergers.

""When you have companies like Facebook and Google censoring American citizens, making it harder for Americans to speak in their own political process, that is a major problem,"" Vance said. ""And yeah, I do think that there should be an antitrust solution to it.""

Meta and Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

On Thursday, Vance will headline two fundraisers in New York City hosted by some of his top supporters in the financial industry. Each event is expected to raise more than $1 million for Trump's presidential campaign."

Apple announced on Monday that its AirPods Pro 2 headphones will become an FDA-cleared hearing aid in the coming weeks through a software update. That means that adults with mild or moderate hearing loss — about 30 million Americans, according to the Food and Drug Administration — will be able to use Apple earphones to amplify specific sounds they want to hear better.

""After you take a hearing test, your AirPods Pro are transformed into a personalized hearing aid, boosting the specific sounds you need in real time, like parts of speech, or elements within your environment,"" Apple's vice president of health, Sumbul Desai, said in the feature's launch video.

The announcement is the latest example of Apple's strategy to break into the health industry, a potential $15 trillion market by the year 2030, according to RBC Capital Markets. Apple CEO Tim Cook has highlighted health features as the company's ""most important contribution to mankind.""

That strategy includes developing FDA-cleared features for its wearable products and replacing what are often more expensive purpose-built medical devices. Since 2020, Apple has added a notification service for irregular heartbeats, an atrial fibrillation reader and an electrocardiogram reader to its Apple Watch, according to FDA filings.

The new feature is a free software update for some AirPods models and will be included with Apple's $249 AirPods Pro 2.

Many over-the-counter hearing aids are much more expensive, according to buyers guides cited by the Hearing Loss Association of America, an advocacy group. While some OTC hearing aids cost as little as $99, most range from $799 into the thousands of dollars.

""What is really cool about Apple now saying their AirPods can be over-the-counter hearing aids, is we're seeing that technology innovation at a price point and in a product that's very mainstream,"" said Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America.

Apple is trying to jump-start AirPods sales after a few soft years.

The company doesn't break out AirPods stats individually, but its Wearables category declined 2% annually for the most recent quarter that sales are available. Analysts say that adding health features like a hearing aid expands the market for the device, which could help sales.

""The hearing aid piece is a very specific use case,"" said Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster, who estimates that AirPods account for about 5% of Apple's total revenue. ""It does open it up to a different market."""

A landmark ruling from the European Union's top court means Ireland will receive 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in unpaid taxes from Apple — a windfall that Dublin had spent several years fighting to avoid. It leaves the small EU member state in a politically awkward, albeit enviable, position. Irish lawmakers will be expected to set out how best to spend the incoming cash injection ahead of a general election, which must be held no later than March next year. In a decision the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said was final, the EU's top court on Tuesday ruled that Apple must pay Ireland billions of euros in back taxes. The decision was welcomed by tax justice advocates as well as the bloc's outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, who described the pronouncement as a ""huge win"" for European citizens. Apple said in a statement that it was disappointed with the ruling, while the Irish government described the case as ""an issue that is now of historical relevance only."" The Irish government said in a statement that its position had always been that it ""does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers."" A spokesperson added that it would now begin the process of transferring the assets held in an escrow fund to Ireland.

""The Irish government in particular are now in a position where they have been telling the Irish people and the international community that they don't want this 13 billion [euros] — it is not ours,"" Aidan Regan, associate professor of political economy at University College Dublin in Ireland, told CNBC via telephone. ""They are confronted with a lot of domestic pressures politically, there's an election probably in a couple of months' time and now they potentially have a windfall of 13 billion [euros] in a context whereby there's huge infrastructural problems and a housing crisis,"" he continued. ""So, I suspect the Irish government will be paying a lot less attention to what is happening internationally and the reputational cost to this ruling and wondering what they are going to say to the Irish electorate ahead of an election in a few weeks' time."" A spokesperson for Ireland's Finance Ministry referred CNBC to the government's written statement when contacted for comment.

A lucrative decision

Ireland, which serves as Apple's base in the EU, has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the 27-nation bloc. For years, Ireland consistently argued that the iPhone maker should not have to repay unpaid taxes to the country. It had contested the case amid fears it may threaten the country's ability to attract investment from companies eager to limit their tax bill on overseas earnings. However, the ECJ's ruling on Tuesday confirmed the European Commission's 2016 decision that the country granted the U.S. tech behemoth ""unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover."" The decision comes at a time when Ireland is in the unusual position of running a budget surplus of several billion euros, partly due to the strength of corporate tax receipts.

""The decision is a lucrative one for Ireland, resulting in a windfall in the country's favour, but undermines the government's long-standing position that Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any taxpayers, companies or otherwise,"" Robert Dever, tax partner at multinational law firm Pinsent Masons, told CNBC via email. ""It is to be hoped that any damage to Ireland's reputation internationally will be limited having regard to the changes to Irish tax code, including to the rules in respect of corporate tax residency and the attribution of profits to branches of non-resident companies, in the last number of years,"" Dever said. ""The process of transferring the assets in the escrow fund, established to hold the funds representing the tax liability and interest purported to be owed by Apple pending the final determination, to Ireland will now be commenced following the judgment today but will take a number of months to be finalized,"" he added.

Tax cooperation

Alex Cobham, CEO of the Tax Justice Network, which tracks corporate tax avoidance, said on Tuesday that he welcomed the ECJ's ruling on Apple's tax affairs in Ireland. ""But the ruling only serves to highlight the abject failure of international tax rules to protect the right of countries to tax the economic activity located in their own jurisdictions,"" Cobham told CNBC via email. ""This points to the urgency of the global reform process now underway through the negotiation of a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation,"" he added.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company's shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple's tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant's headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received ""illegal"" tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission's decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU's second-highest court anulled the Commission's 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage."

As Huawei tries to upstage Apple 's new iPhone with the launch of its own 'trifold phone' on Tuesday, its chip capabilities remain a weakness, despite recent breakthroughs, according to one analyst.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday, Martin Yang, senior analyst of emerging technologies at Oppenheimer & Co., said Huawei's chip remains two or three years behind the cutting edge.

The gap on technology for their systems-on-chip, or SoCs, that merge central processing with cellular connectivity, is ""widening because [Huawei] still doesn't have access to any below 7 nanometer processes,"" said Yang. In chip manufacturing, a nanometer denotes the size of transistors on a processor.

The smaller the size of a transistor, the more can be fit on a chip, increasing its level of advancement.

Huawei had made a smashing breakthrough last year when it released its Mate 60 smartphone, which included an advanced 7-nanometer chip originating from China.

The speed in which Chinese firms were able to reach this benchmark surpassed what many analysts thought possible under U.S. trade restrictions that limited China's access to advanced semiconductor tech.

On the back of this success, Huawei has been able to take back market share from Apple in China, the largest smartphone market in the world.

However, unlike with the Mate 50, Huawei has not announced a big chip breakthrough for its latest phone launch."

Apple's list price for the Phone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus start at $799 and $899, respectively. The higher-end Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,199. ""It's so clear that the [iPhone] price will be dictated by T-Mobile, AT & T and Verizon,"" Jim Cramer said Tuesday, underscoring the important role these carriers play in sparking demand for the devices. The reason: More often than not, iPhone users buy from cellphone providers rather than Apple directly — likely because it's easier for the everyday consumer to stomach trading in their current device to avoid footing the full bill for a new one. A 2022 survey of iPhone buyers found that only 24% of people purchased their devices directly through Apple, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners said at the time . Apple does not disclose this information. These annual bargains and financing deals from T-Mobile, AT & T and Verizon can convince Apple users who may not otherwise feel a pressing need to upgrade. It's been a positive for Apple. ""I think subsidies always help,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on an earnings call a few months after the 2020 launch of the iPhone 12, the first version to support 5G wireless networks. ""Anything that reduces the price to the customer is good for the customer and obviously good for the carrier that's doing it and good for us as well,"" Cook explained. ""It's a win across the board."" AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance The promotional offers for the iPhone 16 are largely in line with those offered for last year's iPhone 15, analysts at UBS and Bernstein said in notes to clients. AT & T CEO John Stankey echoed these sentiments. ""I was looking at the offers in our industry that popped up yesterday after the announcement,"" Stankey said in an interview Tuesday on CNBC . ""They look pretty similar to last year."" That is about what the Club expected to see. Now consider that despite inflation, Apple left the prices of iPhone 16 models the same as the prior generation while adding AI capabilities and improved battery life, among others. Against that backdrop, it's welcome news that carrier subsidies are roughly as enticing as they were last year. Of course, we would've loved if they were more aggressive than a year ago, knowing some consumers are feeling pinched, but this is not a bad outcome when looking at the big picture. To be sure, some Wall Street analysts aren't expecting a step up in upgrades driven the trade-in offers. ""Broadly, we do not believe that the promotions are enough to drive customers to upgrade at a different rate [versus] last year,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a Tuesday note to clients. Likewise, UBS analysts said the telecom deals are ""unlikely to drive demand"" on their own. Apple shares edged lower Tuesday as investors took in some downbeat commentary from analysts on the company's product launch event. ""We don't view the AI-related offerings as compelling enough in the near term to drive significant demand, given macro risk in China and regulatory hurdles in Europe and China, limiting geographic reach of Apple Intelligence,"" analysts at Barclays wrote to clients. The firm is a notable bear on Apple, with an underweight rating on the stock all year long . Our thesis on Apple is unchanged. We maintain the iPhone 16 is the start of a new extended upgrade cycle , fueled in part by new AI features and complemented by improved capabilities to the devices overall, such as better battery life and camera improvements. ""All of these things will be incremental, just enough to eventually convince millions"" to upgrade their devices, Jim said. ""This cycle is not going to be one quarter or two,"" added Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis. ""It will be a multiyear cycle because people are going to need to upgrade to these newer models over time."" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

The reviews on Wall Street are mixed concerning Monday's iPhone launch event. Much of the analysis centered on what we heard on stage about the new artificial intelligence-enabled device. For us, Monday's announcements were not the endgame. They are just the beginning. Jim Cramer on Tuesday took issue with some of the analysts' commentary, which included Bernstein calling the event underwhelming and Citi and JPMorgan occupying the no-surprises camp. Jim cited the totality of the capabilities of the new iPhone 16 from artificial intelligence to longer battery life to better cameras. ""All of these things will be incremental, just enough to eventually convince millions"" over time to upgrade their devices, he added. The iPhone 16 supports the idea that investors should own the stock for the long-term, rather than try to trade in and out based on when more AI features start to launch. The refresh cycle should not be viewed, nor would we want it to be, as a one-quarter event. If it means we shave the upgrade cycle down by 6 to 12 months, that's huge. We came away from Apple's product launch event incrementally more positive in our view that the iPhone 16 is the upgrade catalyst we've been waiting for. Apple Intelligence represents a paradigm shift for the company and the iPhone 16 is the ticket into this new generation. If we take a step back and look at the history of Apple, there have been four major transitions that got us to where we are today. It all started with the computer, the first generation of the company. From there, Apple moved into music with the launch of the iPod, the second generation. The company's next major milestone was the iPhone, the third generation, followed by the launch of services and the App Store, the fourth generation. Apple Intelligence is the next step, the fifth generation, a shift that will completely revamp how we think about and engage with our personal devices. Time will tell just how big a change this is but what we saw at Monday's event was enough to understand that the iPhone 16 represents the future, one in which Siri is more personalized and helpful than ever and all apps start to become smarter. Whether they are enhanced with machine learning in the camera app, helping to get the best shot or improved notification summaries, everything is getting an upgrade. How fast these Apple Intelligence upgrades hit new devices will dictate the pace of upgrades but what Apple announced gives us confidence that it is indeed on the verge of shortening the refresh cycle. If we think back to Nvidia in 2018, we saw a similar dynamic. In 2018, Nvidia unveiled RTX Ray Tracing technology — groundbreaking stuff in the world of computer graphics. The issue at the time was there were not any software or video games taking advantage of it. So, despite being a groundbreaking innovation, we didn't see real upgrade demand come until the software caught up. It's kind of like that now at Apple. The hardware is there, but the software is where we get to the use case. That's what will in turn drive demand, both in terms of Apple rolling out Apple Intelligence and developers taking advantage of the new hardware capabilities. Fortunately, Apple has a fast-growing services business to smooth out this process, and there are many people waiting to upgrade devices regardless of AI. To be sure, we wouldn't expect to see the same volatility in shares of Apple now that we saw with shares of Nvidia back then. The iPhone 16 and the Pro models will be equipped with versions of the new A18 chips. The iPhone 15 Pro models are the only previous devices that can run Apple Intelligence. However,even those phones weren't built from the ground up in the way the iPhone 16 is to harness the full power of Apple's AI features. Anyone used to a large language model such as ChatGPT from Microsoft -backed OpenAI, or Gemini from Alphabet 's Google, or Meta AI, will realize that generative artificial intelligence is very real and incredibly useful. We're all still working to figure out just how big a change it is. But the fact that it's a material change is hard to dispute. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, META.

Market rebound: Stocks were rebounding to start the week, recovering some of Friday's steep losses. It looked like some dip buying after last week's brutal start to September, a historically tough month for stocks. All S & P 500 sectors on Monday were trading firmly in positive territory. Cyclical stocks were outperforming — with financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary leading the way. Communication services was at the bottom of the list — mostly due to weakness in Alphabet. Defensive groups such as utilities, health care, and consumer staples lagged. Information tech was somewhere in the middle. Glowtime: We're keeping track of the new product announcements at Apple's Monday launch event, which was still ongoing when we published Homestretch around 2:15 p.m. ET. The event started with new Apple Watches and AirPods. Then, came what investors were waiting for: details on the new iPhone 16. Apple left the pricing unchanged for the base model at $799 and at $899 for the Plus. However, the market did not initially think that the event was living up to the lofty expectations. Atlanta GDP: We don't often mention updates to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, which in its own words is a ""running estimate of real GDP growth based on available economic data for the current measured quarter."" We now think it's important to keep track of it after the stock market sold off last week on recession fears tied to a weak ISM manufacturing report and soft jobs number. Dispelling this notion, GDPNow raised its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate to 2.5% from its last update of 2.1% on Sept. 4. To be sure, a 2.5% GDPNow growth estimate doesn't suggest a roaring economy. But, it's still solid as we wait for Fed monetary policy to become less restrictive in the months ahead. Up next: Oracle reports earnings after the closing bell, providing insights into data center investment and demand for AI infrastructure. At the Barclays Global Financial Services conference on Tuesday, big banks including Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are scheduled to provide their intra-quarter updates.

We knew they were better than almost all of the other companies out there. We knew that their managements were incredibly good and their prospects enormous. But looking back, we stopped caring at what price we bought these stocks and, instead, decided that they had to be owned no matter what, even if their valuations exceeded their normal bounds. The problem, oddly, isn't that anyone got anything wrong. No, the problem is that even after this monster sell-off that we have been going through, we still can't figure out how to value them. So, let me give you my take on how this now disparate set of stocks became such a motley crew and what we can do about it. GOOGL .SPX YTD mountain Alphabet's year-to-date stock performance compared with the S & P 500. Let's start with Alphabet , not just because it is an alphabetical favorite but also because it's the most difficult one of all of these stocks. The reason? It's actually cheap. At about 18 times forward earnings estimates, according to FactSet, it's solidly below the S & P 500 's valuation on the same metric. Alphabet is besieged on many fronts. Google's parent company just lost a critical case in federal court against the Department of Justice. The government alleged that the company used all sorts of illegal ways to maintain its monopoly in the general online search market and, in what was a bit of shock, beat Alphabet ; the company has said it will appeal. On Monday, the government will go after Alphabet for squelching competition in advertising . It doesn't have a monopoly on digital ads, but after the search case ruling a month ago, I don't know if it matters. Alphabet could lose anyway. Meanwhile, its Waymo autonomous driving business is demonstrating what it has always demonstrated: no profits to show after years of testing and more recently robotaxi rides. Regulatory scrutiny aside, its search business, could eventually be under siege by AI engines built on large language models. Not yet — the engagement numbers are still real good — but it's a threat. Google's Gemini isn't mentioned much when we are talking about startup Anthropic's Claude or Perplexity's Perplexity AI or OpenAI's ChatGPT or even Meta.ai from Club holding Meta Platforms . Despite this, YouTube is the single best video property on earth. While it is not worth $1.88 trillion, the current market cap of the whole company, it is extremely valuable. Now, here's where the rubber hits the road. Wall Street is looking for roughly 14% earnings growth next year, much better than almost every company in the S & P 500. Yet we give it a haircut to the S & P 500. What should we do with Alphabet? Sell the stock so its multiple falls even further? Sell it because it is too expensive when it isn't? I have frequently expressed my frustration with the company and stock, but every time we trimmed it — and we have trimmed it multiple times over the past year — it has gone higher. Real bad reason not to sell it all. That said, how can you not be intrigued about owning shares in a company where the worst thing that could happen to it is to have it broken up by the U.S. government? Of course, it's now part of all of these stupid ""Magnificent Seven"" exchange-traded funds, which was great when it was being pulled up by them but not so hot when it is being brought down by them. I think it's biggest problem, literally its biggest, is that its market cap is $1.9 trillion. Therefore, it seems too big versus the rest of the market, except for the rest of its Mag 7 peers and Club holding Eli Lilly . It's just a fact of life. Now you might say, what if search gets much less profitable than it is? All I would say is that's why you are paying so little relative to the S & P 500 for the stock. Could it possibly be a value trap? That it doesn't get cheaper as it goes lower? Frankly, that's the only explanation for how it's traded — that it really is a value trap and when it reports earnings, we will all gasp at how business has fallen off a cliff. But we have no evidence whatsoever that that is the case. So, we own it for the Club, having sold and sold and sold some more. We are down to tag ends of the position and I want to see if it can go higher, even as that seems an impossibility right now. AMZN YTD mountain Amazon's year-to-date stock performance. Ever since Amazon made those cautionary comments on its Aug. 1 earnings call about the consumer after a couple of weak days in the summer, the stock just can't make a move without the sellers reasserting themselves. Amazingly, though, what people are ignoring is that its most lucrative business, Amazon Web Services, is accelerating. Plus, my contacts indicate Amazon had a monster Amazon Prime Day and its fast-growing advertising business remains quite strong. None of that matters right now. All that matters was that throwaway line about shopping during a period when shopping is not that important anyway. Here's what I see happening: I believe the company is using every bit of its AI smarts to figure out your ordering patterns so it can save money sending you what you order. It needs to be able to bunch orders together so it doesn't end up sending trucks to your house multiple times a day. In the meantime, one look at Walgreens , one of Amazon's main competitors, tells you that if you are in a town that Walgreens dominates, be prepared to be dominated by Amazon. The problem all comes down to valuation. Amazon is projected to grow earnings per share by almost 25% next year. We are paying 36 times earnings for that growth. I could easily argue that I could pay twice its growth rate as a P/E multiple given how good the company is. That won't fly in this market, though. With all growth stocks of Amazon's kind, I look at projected earnings further out on the horizon to help determine what it's worth. Sure enough, if you go out to 2026, this stock is selling at 23 times earnings. Sorry, that's just too cheap. There's an issue here, though, that we must stay focused on: That low P/E multiple presents no defense against selling. As ridiculous as it is, if Amazon were to use some of its bountiful cash to give you a 3% dividend yield — something it could but would be wrong to do because we want Amazon's growth — the sellers would walk away because of the current interest rate of U.S. government bonds. Put it all together, and there's plenty of reasons to own Amazon. The only reason not to is if consumers' spending continued to decline from the problems seen in the summer. I don't think that will happen, but this won't matter until Amazon actually reports third-quarter numbers, and that's a long time to wait. That makes people sell it now and figure they can buy it back before the report. I have no retort for the waiting-to-report story. I wish I did. I don't. I just think the consumer is going to come back and back and back to Amazon, and when interest rates go lower, this one will be terrific. No reason for the excessive decline other than people determined to get out of the Mag 7, perhaps via ETFs. Friday's big decline — down $6.50 a share, or 3.65% — felt like short-selling to me. Who else sells this stock down more than $5 other than people who think it will be down another $2 or $4 at the next open because the market is even worse than we thought? AAPL YTD mountain Apple's year-to-date stock performance. Monday is Apple's iPhone launch event with the ""Glowtime"" theme, and I have been through enough of these product unveils to know they are often regarded as a disappointment. Some of that is because Apple steals its own thunder as it did months ago at its June developers conference. That's when it revealed a partnership with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into Apple's new devices. It's maybe the greatest free-rider deal in history, with Apple reportedly not paying OpenAI as part of it . When I talked to CEO Tim Cook that fateful developer day, he emphasized to me that ChatGPT may not be the only AI provider to the iPhone. That tantalizing moment was instrumental in our decision to keep Alphabet on the sheets: Who wants to wake up finding out that Alphabet gave Apple access to Gemini? Like many others, I was stunned to find out that Apple was able to collaborate with the acknowledged best AI agent there is, at least for now. What an incredible coup. Moreover, it was an astounding homage to what Apple had built, not because of the actual iPhone but because of what we all call ""the revenue stream."" It's a chief reason why I decided to make this stock an ""own it, don't trade it"" talisman. Why not? I always thought that the big issue is a bind between Apple and the company's more than 1 billion users. It is a testament to the power of Apple's management that we really don't even know how many paying consumers they have. We just know that it's a heck of a lot more than anybody else. So, with that knowledge, the other influential tech players want to be a part of the juggernaut. If you read the lawsuit against Alphabet by the U.S. government, you know that its payment to Apple is at the heart of what made Google Search the putative search winner, perhaps the chief reason why Google defeated Microsoft's Bing. Alphabet paid a lot of money to be default search provider for this audience, which is perhaps the better word for ""the revenue stream."" This brings me to something I am determined to try to explain to all: The Mag 7 is now a sham. There's been concern about overspending on AI among that cohort, but how could you lump in Apple with the rest of them, given its partnership approach means it has spent far less on capital expenditures for AI? Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are givers. Apple is a taker. It's again why I think that Apple is such a gem. Apple's iPhone is a free rider, too, at least in the U.S. T-Mobile, AT & T and Verizon will all compete to offer this seminal AI-infused iPhone to all of us. The product th are offering is so good that it is at the heart of an antitrust suit filed earlier this year by the no-nothing Justice Department . Ah, but you say, how can we pay a plus-30 earnings multiple for a company that historically rarely traded in the 20s? The nonbelievers just say it's simple: Dump the stock, and dump it furiously. The believers like myself marvel at its federal sin of dominance and its unassailable audience that rises to the occasion and creates a new company within a company: the most sticky revenue stream, the most consistent, the most bankable, the most worthy of a high multiple of any company. You could argue that Apple's now a different company worth much more, perhaps enough to even justify the multiple. I wish it were lower, but perhaps it will be if the launch is huge and drives stronger-than-expected earnings growth. I don't like the way the analysts talk about the stock, but in the end it doesn't matter. It's not expensive if you believe that the most important part of Apple is the razor blade, not the razor. Don't tell that to Apple's management, though, because it is a backhanded attack on the technology, and Apple's a proud innovative technology company. The iPhone is a work of genius, not a Gillette razor that can support some vibrating blade. Apple is the most vulnerable of the Mag 7, and it will be fraught and fractious from Monday's get-go. META YTD mountain Meta's year-to-date stock performance. With Meta, here's a company that's becoming — if it isn't there already — Nvidia 's biggest customer. It's the one that seems to want its next-generation AI chip platform Blackwell because it needs to offer the best ads to synch with your content. Talk about a tremendous model. I keep hearing the argument that the use cases for AI are mostly chimerical. But the real use case is buried right in Meta's most recent conference call. With a lot of Blackwells, Meta can make ads for big consumer packaged goods and entertainment companies, even for Amazon, that reach exactly who they are supposed to reach. When it is done, I think Meta will be the only company with a demonstrable return on investment for those companies, which crave the simplicity of a better product than what its creative people and those of the ad agencies can possibly produce. Can you imagine the perfect reach for a fraction of the cost — fueled by Blackwell's computing power — all at a very low earnings multiple versus the rest of its false compadres? Talk about winner take all! Meta has other irons in the fire, but its ""audience"" is twice as big as Apple's. It can't be challenged, and it is all laid out in the remarkable second quarter conference call in a moment of incredible candor by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who gets what Nvidia's Jensen Huang can see more than any other executive. No wonder the chief executives are true partners. When you have a fabulous ad solution you need a deserving multiple. A little over 23 times 2024 earnings seems ridiculously low. So, it's a buy, to say nothing of the under-earnings parts of business such as WhatsApp. You can't rule out the stock trading higher on its own merits. MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft's year-to-date stock performance. Go back to Microsoft's last earnings conference call and you have a marvel of perfection – save one line from the redoubtable CFO Amy Hood, who indicated a momentary decline in the growth of Azure. That's the company's remarkable web service system that's up from nothing and still underutilized. People are now judging Microsoft by the deployment of Copilot, its AI digital assistant tool that has had mixed reception after an original explosion of usage. Microsoft doesn't get much credit for its many other businesses. But I wonder if that changes, given the sudden dismissal by investors of all things AI as a colossal boondoggle, just a honeypot for the now much-derided Nvidia. Microsoft's embrace of ChatGPT and OpenAI, the first partner of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, is worth so much more to the company that dropped the Bing call so long ago that the defensive need can be justified or the longer term. We fail to acknowledge how invulnerable Microsoft is to the Justice Department's caprice. Call it the ""been there, done that"" win of the Justice Department 24 years ago. Microsoft is not considered a monopolist because it's proven not to be one. We often talk about why tech isn't contained by the Federal Reserve's actions or an economic slowdown. I believe its high multiple makes sense. It is never talked about as expensive, even as it is quite pricey. It's another reason I hate the Mag 7 concept I foolishly embraced on ""Mad Money."" Why lump this forward-looking company with other companies that haven't proven themselves yet? This fantastic company has so many assets, including LinkedIn to dominate the modern Rolodex and recently acquired video game firm Activision to control distribution and mindshare. What's not to like except its extremely high multiple? But then again when has it ever had a small one? NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia's year-to-date stock performance. We've never seen a company strap on $2 trillion in market value after a couple of earnings surprises. Because we have never seen it, we don't know what to do with it except, of course, sell it. Isn't that what's going on? My friend Michael Cembalest at JPMorgan took a real machete to the AI pseudo-bubble last week , and if you read the fine print, it's the fault of the hyperscalers, the actual stars themselves, not Nvidia. That doesn't make it any better for the now easily shorted behemoth, which so many now think has no clothes. I beg to differ. I believe in Jensen and I believe in the confluence of two megatrends: accelerated computing and generative AI. The fact that this is the only company that has even thought of any of this, that it has spent billions upon billions of dollars to nail it, only attracts the ire of this Doubting Anticapitalistic Thomas of a Justice Department that must go if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the election, or all stocks should trade at lower price-to-earnings multiples. Here's my query to you: If everything can be made better by the platform filled with hardware and software, then what's that company worth? How about more – not less – than it's selling for? When I came up with the ""own it, don't trade it"" designation for this stock, Huang was elated. Finally, someone understood what he was doing. A declining stock now puts me on the daily firing line, which Is now just excruciating. The Achilles heel of Nvidia is the self-proclaimed overpay by customers for all the reiterations of the latest and greatest platforms. Sure, the prices seem fanciful, but the use cases are the providence of Huang and he will tell you that the right ones are of immediate impact. Also, I point out that Nvidia is the gem of the ocean. No one is near it, including fellow Club holding Advanced Micro Devices . Still, the company is valued like a steel mill that produces great numbers and then bad numbers as things go wrong or need refurbishing. The most recent earnings, just in line, may have been much better if its much-anticipated Blackwell chips were ready. The reverberations of that delay are still with us. They will remain with us until there are customer announcements that will dispel the Blackwell disappointments. Orders and announcements could stem the blood-dimmed tide of next-gen opportunities. TSLA YTD mountain Tesla's year-to-date stock performance. I hate the smugness of the shareholder base of this company. They love to buy shares of anything that CEO Elon Musk says or does. Did you ever notice this company's stock trades at more than 90 times earnings, and it is unquestioned as a meaningless stat? I have always hated investing in that kind of situation because it is not meaningless to most investors. This is unnerving. It is a car company. It can't be all the other Musk interests because they are all walled off from this. It is a car company, an EV car company where other companies have not succeeded. It is about to be clobbered by excellent Chinese entries. The Cybertruck is too boutique. The self-driving gambit seems more like a loser than a winner. And none of it matters because of this one man who is so good at everything he tries. Of the Mag 7, this one is the most annoying. It is just a battleground between those who hate him and those who like him. But let me be blunt. Of all the stocks in this roundup, there is only one that deserves a heavy P/E discount and it's Tesla. It does it because it keeps surprising itself with new editions. He surprises his audience with hope that he's got something big on the line and if he doesn't, it's no big deal. The overpromising and underdelivering would destroy most stocks in the Mag 7, but not this one. When considering the most problematic of stocks, they really shouldn't be linked to others in the Mag 7. I need you to think of that when they all come down. If you know the score, then sell the ones that you don't like into strength. But don't get caught up in only these seven. Hundreds of stocks are working right now, and only the Mag 7 isn't computing. I say don't get discouraged. The others can't help but come up when these go down. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GOOGL, LLY, AMZN, AAPL, META, MSFT, AMD and NVDA.

Your satisfaction with the college you choose may play a significant role in determining whether you finish your degree at all. Emotional stress is the No. 1 reason college students have considered discontinuing their studies, according to a recent Gallup poll.

Of course, there are plenty of reasons students may be unhappy in college that are unrelated to their campus of choice. But a school where students report high levels of satisfaction may be a good sign for prospective applicants.

Auburn University in Alabama earns that reputation. It's the U.S. college with the happiest students for 2025, according to The Princeton Review. The publication ranked colleges based on how strongly students agreed with the statement ""I am happy at my school"" in nationwide surveys.

Here are the 10 colleges with the happiest students:

Auburn University — Auburn, Alabama Kansas State University — Manhattan, Kansas Taylor University — Upland, Indiana University of Dallas — Irving, Texas Thomas Aquinas College — Santa Paula, California Texas Christian University — Fort Worth, Texas Washington State University — Pullman, Washington Marist College — Poughkeepsie, New York Emory University — Atlanta, Georgia Angelo State University — San Angelo, Texas

""I loved my experience at Auburn,"" said Carolina Williams, a 25-year-old who chose Auburn over Yale University in 2017. ""I made amazing friends there. I got involved in great organizations that just provided amazing experiences for me,"" she told CNBC Make It earlier this year.

One of the largest universities in the South with over 26,000 undergraduates, Auburn boasts a wide variety of majors and activities. Students there can get involved with world-class research or check out some of the country's premier college sports competitions.

""You literally can just go ask [professors], 'What are you researching? Can I help you?' And the answer is yes,"" Williams said.

DON'T MISS: How to master your money and grow your wealth

Many Auburn students — including Apple CEO Tim Cook, who graduated in 1982 — go on to find success after college. Alumni in the first five years of their career earn a median of $69,700 a year, and those with 10 years of work experience earn a median of $126,100, according to Payscale.

Plus, more than half of Auburn alumni say their work makes the world a better place, Payscale found.

Three other public universities — Kansas State, Washington State and Angelo State — join Auburn in the top 10 schools with the happiest students. Many students prefer the often larger student bodies, more expansive fields of study and affordability that public colleges typically offer, compared with private schools.

On the other hand, plenty of students are happy at private colleges that might offer a more personalized or specialized experience. Universities such as Taylor and Texas Christian have religious ties that may be important to students' well-being, for example.

In late 2022, OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT spurred an explosion of interest in the possibilities for artificial intelligence. Within months, some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Microsoft , Meta and Google , joined the party, launching their own AI chatbots and generative AI tools. By the end of 2023, Nvidia proved it was the only company in the world positioned to make huge amounts of money by powering those services. Fast-forward to 2024, and a big theme in AI involves our consumer favorite gadgets, with tech companies trying to bring AI to phones and laptops. Earlier this year, Samsung launched its AI-powered Galaxy S24 smartphone. Microsoft, partnering with companies like Dell , HP and Qualcomm , started selling a new crop of AI computers over the summer called Copilot+ PCs. A few weeks ago, Google launched its Pixel 9 series of AI phones. So far, these new devices have underwhelmed. Rather than creating whole new experiences, they've introduced features for making it easier to edit photos, talk to a chatbot or provide live captions for videos. Then there's Humane's AI pin, a clip-on gizmo that launched in April and was immediately panned in reviews. By August, reports surfaced that daily returns were outpacing sales. Apple will try to change the narrative. On Monday, the company is expected to show off its new family of iPhones, packed with the AI capabilities announced in June. The system is called Apple Intelligence, and it'll be rolling out over the coming months. Current Apple devices like the iPhone 15 Pro and some newer iPads and Macs will also have access to it.

But Apple Intelligence will be free. So the company needs to convince hundreds of millions of iPhone customers that it's time for an upgrade. That's what Wall Street is watching for when the latest iPhones go on sale this month. Will Apple Intelligence move more iPhones? Or will the post-pandemic sales slump continue? ""The reality is GenAI is still in its early stages and use cases that have been announced are probably only the tip of the iceberg of what's to come,"" said Nabila Popal, a mobile analyst at IDC. Apple plans to roll out Apple Intelligence in stages. It will initially only be available in U.S. English, and will likely be blocked in countries with strict AI regulations, like China. Plus, many of the features Apple announced in June won't be ready on Day 1. Instead, they'll be introduced in phases over the coming months. Because of Apple's measured rollout strategy, even the most bullish analysts expect it to take years for the company to get its AI into the hands of the 1 billion or so iPhone users. Do consumers want AI gadgets? Apple typically adds modest enhancements to its iPhones each year. The camera gets a little better. The processors are faster. The battery life improves. None of that is compelling enough to get consumers to rush to upgrade every year or two as they did in the earlier days of the iPhone when big hardware innovations were standard. You can expect the same kind of iterative hardware improvements for this year's phones. That puts more pressure on Apple Intelligence to deliver. But consumer appetite is a question mark. Results from a recent survey by research firm Canalys showed just 7% of consumers had a ""very high inclination"" to make a purchasing decision because of AI. Interest is significantly higher in Apple's two most lucrative markets, the U.S. and China, but there's a giant disparity between them. In the U.S., 15% of respondents said they had a high or very high inclination to buy gadgets because of AI. In China, where consumers tend to care more about tech specs, that number was 43%. The relatively muted interested, especially in the U.S., suggests that Apple will need its marketing machine to tell a compelling story around what AI can do for the typical iPhone user. ""There are lots of interesting features, but you have to bring those to the normal user in situations they can use repeatedly, not just a one-time feature,"" said Gerrit Schneemann, an analyst at Counterpoint Technology. ""It's hard to tell that story in a store with a poster or a two-second sales pitch.""

Apple Intelligence will use the personal data stored on your phone and help supercharge Siri into a more capable assistant. Plus, app developers will be able tap into Apple intelligence, so you can use it everywhere on your phone. Schneemann said that's a fresh take on AI compared with Google or Samsung. ""There is the potential to help speed up that educational curve and permeate into the market,"" he said. Samsung's Galaxy S24, its latest flagship device, has sold better than last year's model. But there's little evidence that AI is the primary driver, IDC's Popal said. Apple is in another category. ""The psyche for premium Apple customers is different,"" Popal said, adding that many iPhone customers buy their phones using financing plans, which make it easier to upgrade. More recently, Google launched its Pixel 9 series of phones, which has the company's digital AI assistant, Gemini, built directly into the software. Google's smartphones have never been major sellers, but they often show what's possible on Android phones before those features make their way to Samsung or Motorola devices. The marquee feature on the Pixel is a version of Gemini that can carry out natural conversations instead of responding to one command at a time, a capability other Android phones with Gemini should get in the future. While the reviews for the Pixel 9 were positive, it's still too early to tell if AI can finally juice sales. In the PC market, Microsoft's Copilot+ PCs launched this summer, but without their marquee AI feature, Recall. (Microsoft learned the hard way it's not a good idea to launch a product that takes screenshots of everything you do on your computer every few seconds.) Recall will hit this market later this fall for a limited number of early testers. Without Recall, there's not much AI in this batch of AI PCs. The real benefit for now seems to be the power and performance from the new PC chips from Qualcomm that debuted in Copilot+ PCs. The processors are based on the same technology as your phone chip, meaning they're still plenty powerful without using up the battery. ""This is the transition of the traditional PC, turning it to look like a mobile device,"" said Alex Katouzian, Qualcomm's general manager for mobile and wearable technology. He said Microsoft is working on more AI features and fixing the privacy issues with Recall. Microsoft said it expects 50 million Copilot+ PCs to ship this year, which would represent about 1 in 5 PCs expected to be sold. Katouzian said Qualcomm-powered Copilot PCs are ""on track"" so far. Still, Copilot PCs made up ""a relatively small percentage"" of PC sales at Best Buy this summer, CEO Corie Barry said on the company's most recent earnings call. She added that customers ""just want to replace and upgrade"" without necessarily looking for a device with AI or spending a premium for it. Apple's AI rollout If Apple can buck the trend and successfully wow its customers with Apple Intelligence, the next step will be rolling it out globally to drive iPhone sales in markets outside the U.S. There are other roadblocks in its way. China, where Apple generates nearly a fifth of its sales, requires government approval before an AI model can launch in the country. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in August his team is working with regulators in China to make that happen. Then there's the EU, which has passed a slew of stringent laws regulating the world's largest technology companies. Apple said this summer it won't launch Apple Intelligence right away in the EU because of those regulations. In the meantime, Apple Intelligence users will be members of a relatively exclusive club. Apple's job is to convince customers to pay up for a new device and join. ""We're very excited about the value that Apple Intelligence gives to users,"" Cook told CNBC in August. ""For that reason, we think it's another compelling reason to upgrade ... we'll see how the season goes once we start shipping, but we're very excited about it.""

Plastic hotel key cards have had a rough few years. During the pandemic, touch was taboo, so touchless trends accelerated. And cybersecurity concerns have mounted around hotel key technology. Earlier this year, researchers found a vulnerability in plastic hotel keys that could render up to three million keys easy prey for hackers and take years to fix.

Cybersecurity and safety issues have prompted many hotel chains to accelerate plans to transform hotel room door locks. While major U.S. chains have had the digital key capability for years, Google Wallet and Apple Wallet are jumping in by offering hotels the ability to save guests' room keys to their wallets, enabling them to access their rooms by simply tapping the back of their phones against a reader near the door handle.

Hilton Hotels has its Honors app, which allows guests to check in and use a room key through their smartphone. The 119-room Harpeth Hotel in Franklin, Tennessee, is a Hilton property, and guests can check in digitally and store keys in their Google or Apple wallet app.

""The benefit to the digital check-in is that your phone is the key,"" said Kimberly Elder, director of sales for the Harpeth Hotel, adding that many guests still prefer the plastic key cards.

Eli Fuchs, regional director of operations at Valor Hospitality Partners, which has Hilton and Holiday Inn Express hotels in its portfolio, says digital is the next wave in hotel room door technology.

""Traditional hotel room keys are staring down the end of their existence,"" Fuchs says.

However, some security experts caution that even the newer lock methods aren't foolproof.

""Keyless systems can introduce entirely new threat vectors for hotel security operations to manage,"" said Lee Clark, cyber threat intelligence production manager at Retail and Hospitality Information Sharing and Analysis Center (RH-ISAC).

While Clark says these threats can be mitigated through security control policies and configurations, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), these introduce extra steps that harried guests may not always want to jump through.

Clark says it's unlikely that all hotels will replace all key cards with digital keys any time soon because some guests may prefer a key card or may not have a personal device compatible with digital lock systems, along with the expense.

""Transitioning to digital and keyless lock systems carries a significant cost in equipment, installation, maintenance, and security,"" Clark said.

Hotel chains begin to require digital key systems

And human habits keep getting in the way, too.

For instance, data from J.D. Power's research on hotels found that only 14% of total branded hotel guests used digital keys during their hotel stay. Even guests who downloaded the brand's app to their phones used the plastic key card.

According to J.D. Power data, among guests who have the app for the hotel company/brand, 30% use a digital key, and 70% use a plastic card most of the time.

On the other hand, many hotels simply haven't installed locks capable of digital entry.

""Several large hotel chains, whose apps are most likely to support digital keys, are beginning to require that hotel franchise owner to install new door locks as part of updated brand standards,"" said Andrea Stokes, hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power.

Despite the slow adoption of digital options by customers, J.D. Power data does show that keyless customers feel safer than those using plastic cards.

""Guests using 'digital key' provide significantly more positive ratings for safety of the hotel compared to those who did not use digital keys,"" Stokes said.

Chad Spensky, CEO of Allthenticate, which develops smartphone access capability and credential management, compares the plastic key card to passwords, which cybersecurity specialists view as low-tech and dated.

""We all still use passwords, despite the glaring security holes and clunky user experience. In the same way, key cards are likely here to stay,"" Spensky said.

He says the real promise of digital cards is less about security and more about convenience.

""While the card implementations are no more secure than their plastic counterparts, their user experience is far superior,"" Spensky said. If given a choice between shuffling around a bunch of plastic cards or having your smartphone, ""the phone is a clear winner.""

The consumer convenience factor is pushing hotel chains forward in their quest for digital keys. While digital keys offer an additional attack surface, they also allow for quick course correction.

One of the biggest problems with keycards, Spensky says, is that when a vulnerability is discovered there is no easy way to patch the vulnerability, ""With smartphones patches can be pushed out almost instantly over the air,"" he said.

Don't count out the plastic key card yet

Mehmet Erdem, professor, and chair of the department of resort, gaming, and golf management at the University of Las Vegas's William F. Harrah College of Hospitality, warns that no system is foolproof and that people shouldn't let digital entry give them a false sense of security.

""Everything can be hacked, everything can be breached,"" Erdem said. ""If someone has the intention to hack, it will happen.""

Erdem says not to count the plastic key card out yet. There are magnetic key cards that require a swipe and the newer radio frequency identification (RFID) cards that simply require proximity or can be loaded onto a phone. Erdem says RFID technology is improving, which makes plastic keys more versatile.

""RFID is not outdated,"" Erdem said, adding that it allows people who want less interaction to download the app, get the key, activate it, and go to the room.

""Because of sustainability and cost, hotels will push for mobile app,"" Erdem said, but he added that some people will always prefer the physical plastic key. The advantage of the digital version of a plastic key, he said, comes down to human nature. ""People forget their wallets, people forget their ID, but they don't forget their phone.""

But in Las Vegas, where people routinely head to their hotel rooms flush with winnings from the blackjack tables and slots, there is an old-fashioned, low-tech option that makes the door discussion moot.

""There's always the safe in the room, the guests should use that if they have something very valuable,"" Erdem said."

Now, the question remains: Will Wall Street be impressed this time around with the new AI-enabled iPhone, at least enough for the stock to sustain its recent run? Apple has relied heavily on AI optimism to advance 38% since its lows of the year on April 19 through Tuesday's close, outperforming the S & P 500 by roughly 25 percentage points over that same timeframe. Apple was able to outperform despite a three-week skid between mid-July and early August that sent shares into correction territory, as a rotation away from large tech stocks and later recession concerns hit the market. Shares of Apple have regained their footing, though, and are within a typically strong period for the stock in the 10-day run-up to the latest iPhone announcement. The stakes are especially high this year, given the source of the stock's strength in recent months has been Apple's generative artificial intelligence efforts . Investors hope that new AI features will boost iPhone sales — which make up nearly half of overall revenue — and offset weakness in its second-largest market, China. Apple outlined its long-awaited slate of AI tools, dubbed Apple Intelligence, at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Investors at the time liked what they saw, with shares surging the following day to a then-record close of $207.15 a share. The stock continued to climb into the next month, ultimately closing at a record of $234.82 on July 16. That peak roughly coincided with a slew of bullish Wall Street calls, including Morgan Stanley naming Apple its favorite U.S. IT hardware pick and raising the stock's price target. Then that sell-off ensued. The stock – currently a little more than 3% off its July highs – could climb back to record levels if Apple gives users another reason to upgrade their iPhones during the launch-event keynote on Sept. 9. Investors also need assurance that consumers are going to buy the newest model in droves in the months ahead. Clarifying when the new AI features will be available on its devices should help with that. Apple typically announces the release dates for the newest iPhone models and its operating system at the annual launch event. But this year, many of these anticipated AI features are expected to be available after the iPhone 16 and its newest software system, the iOS 18, are released. We understand the desire to have a bug-free Apple Intelligence rollout, but the sooner the company can flex its buzzy AI features such as new writing tools, custom emojis, and an enhanced Siri digital assistant, the sooner users may be convinced to swap up to newer models. Siri seems like a big focus for Apple. This year's launch invite includes the phrase, ""It's Glowtime,"" which is likely a reference to the company's Siri interface redesign. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Investors also will be watching the sticker price of iPhone 16 and other new hardware products when they're revealed at the keynote. Among the questions: Will management raise these prices substantially given the expected AI capabilities? And if so, will the updates woo consumers enough to buy them? Although we don't have an ideal price point in mind for these devices, our hope is the cost is reasonable enough for Apple users to trade up their devices in the future. CFRA Research analysts expect that prices for the two standard iPhone 16 models will remain the same, starting at $799 for the 6.1-inch device and $899 for the 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus. But, the firm speculated that the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max could face a $100 price increase. ""What will be more telling is if AAPL decides to hike the price across its four devices as it offers Apple Intelligence (AI), which itself is no small cost,"" the firm wrote in a Tuesday note. ""AAPL could also boost the memory across all the phones as it did with the Pro Max last year to further justify an increase. Including AI capabilities, the trend of rising component costs and larger screens for the Pros make us believe that some price hikes could be in order."" Improvements in the battery life of the iPhone 16 would be another welcome development, representing a reason to upgrade independent of Apple Intelligence. ""We need to see how much battery life there is because there's a lot of people who will trade up if they can have a battery that will last for a day,"" Jim Cramer said on Tuesday. To be sure, Apple Intelligence is likely to be the main driver of the upgrade cycle because those features will only be compatible on the new iPhone 16 and last year's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max versions. Morgan Stanley estimates the company will ship nearly 500 million iPhones over its next two fiscal years, 6% above the biggest upgrade cycle in history between fiscal 2021 and 2022, the firm said in its July note, which elevated Apple to its top pick. Apple's fiscal year 2024 ends in September. Wedbush Securities also is forecasting a record upgrade cycle fueled by AI. In a note to clients this week, analysts argued Apple's financial windfall from AI over time could lift its market capitalization above $4 trillion. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL.

""It's still one more reason why Apple's worth so much money. It's what other companies wish they could do,"" he said. ""You can't sleep well at night if you have a portfolio of tech stocks, but Apple's made it as easy as possible this time.""

The iPhone maker announced Monday it would replace CFO Luca Maestri with Kevan Parekh, who has worked at the company for more than a decade. He is set to continue at Apple after the transition, leading the corporate services team, the company said.

Cramer praised Maestri's work, saying he has added value for shareholders, helped the company expand into emerging markets and successfully bought back stock. Apple shares are up more than 800% since Maestri became CFO in 2014, and the company's annual sales have more than doubled since then.

But According to Cramer, ""this is the most seamless possible transition that I can recall."" Parekh is known by many analysts, Cramer added, and has solid experience from his time as Apple's vice president of financial planning and analysis. Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement said Parekh has been an ""indispensable"" member of the company's financial leadership team, and that he ""understands the company inside and out."" Before Apple, Parekh worked at Thomson Reuters and General Motors.

Apple made its announcement Monday after the market close, and its stock initially dipped in extended trading, but it rallied during Tuesday's session, finishing up 0.37%.

""I can't think of a thing Apple does wrong when it comes to running the business day to day, and I know that Luca played a big role in that,"" Cramer said. ""The highest compliment I can pay? I bet Kevan Parekh will do exactly the same."""

Apple announced Monday that it will replace Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri on Jan. 1 with current Apple insider Kevan Parekh.

Maestri will continue to lead teams focusing on IT, security and real estate development, Apple said.

Parekh, the incoming CFO, had been a top Maestri lieutenant as the company's vice president of financial planning and analysis.

""For more than a decade, Kevan has been an indispensable member of Apple's finance leadership team, and he understands the company inside and out. His sharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apple's next CFO,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

Maestri was named Apple CFO in 2014 before the stock began a torrid run, partially powered by strong demand for iPhones. Apple stock is up more than 800% since Maestri became CFO.

During his tenure as finance chief, Apple more than doubled annual sales and net income and expanded its gross margin. In 2014, Apple's annual sales were about $183 billion. Last year, Apple reported $383 billion in revenue.

Maestri oversaw Apple's record-breaking capital return program, and appeared alongside Cook on quarterly earnings calls.

Maestri, 60, started his career with General Motors and spent two decades at the automaker, helping to establish its operations in the Asia Pacific region. He then served as CFO at Nokia Siemens and Xerox before joining Apple as corporate controller in 2013. He was promoted to CFO the following year.

Parekh joined Apple in finance and product marketing in 2013 after four years at Thomson Reuters. Similar to Maestri, he previously worked at GM, including in overseas operations.

Apple is not the only Silicon Valley giant experiencing a shake-up in finance. At Alphabet, Ruth Porat announced in July 2023 that she was leaving the CFO role to become president and chief investment officer. In June, the company finally announced a replacement, bringing in Anat Ashkenazi, who had been leading finance at Eli Lilly. A year before Porat's move was made public, Meta named Susan Li as CFO, replacing David Wehner, who was becoming chief strategy officer."

Apple announced it will hold a press event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Monday, Sept. 9, where the company is expected to announce new iPhones and Apple Watch models.

The launch event will be streamed on Apple's website and YouTube. Apple has launched products through pre-recorded videos since 2020.

Apple typically releases new iPhones and Apple Watches at its fall launches ahead of the critical holiday shopping season.

This year's iPhone models, which could be called the iPhone 16, could include bigger screens on the high-end devices, a redesigned camera bump, and a new color, according to analysts and Bloomberg. Apple's wearables are expected to get a new faster chip.

Apple also typically announces the release data of the newest version of the iPhone software for all users alongside the new models.

This year's version is called iOS 18, and will eventually include Apple Intelligence, a collection of AI features for daily usage like summarizing messages and generating cute images. However, Apple's recent developer preview signaled that Apple Intelligence features will likely launch shortly after Apple's hardware launch.

This year's invites include the tagline ""It's Glowtime,"" a reference to Apple's new redesign of its Siri interface."

Instead, they're running tests on Google's own microchips, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. Originally trained for internal workloads, Google's TPUs have been available to cloud customers since 2018. In July, Apple revealed it uses TPUs to train AI models underpinning Apple Intelligence. Google also relies on TPUs to train and run its Gemini chatbot. ""The world sort of has this fundamental belief that all AI, large language models, are being trained on Nvidia , and of course Nvidia has the lion's share of training volume. But Google took its own path here,"" said Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. He's been covering Google's custom cloud chips since they launched in 2015. Google was the first cloud provider to make custom AI chips. Three years later, Amazon Web Services announced its first cloud AI chip, Inferentia. Microsoft 's first custom AI chip, Maia, wasn't announced until the end of 2023. But being first in AI chips hasn't translated to a top spot in the overall rat race of generative AI. Google's faced criticism for botched product releases, and Gemini came out more than a year after OpenAI's ChatGPT. Google Cloud, however, has gained momentum due in part to AI offerings. Google parent company Alphabet reported cloud revenue rose 29% in the most recent quarter, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time. ""The AI cloud era has completely reordered the way companies are seen, and this silicon differentiation, the TPU itself, may be one of the biggest reasons that Google went from the third cloud to being seen truly on parity, and in some eyes, maybe even ahead of the other two clouds for its AI prowess,"" Newman said.

'A simple but powerful thought experiment'

In July, CNBC got the first on-camera tour of Google's chip lab and sat down with the head of custom cloud chips, Amin Vahdat. He was already at Google when it first toyed with the idea of making chips in 2014.

Amin Vahdat, VP of Machine Learning, Systems and Cloud AI at Google, holds up TPU Version 4 at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, on July 23, 2024. Marc Ganley

""It all started with a simple but powerful thought experiment,"" Vahdat said. ""A number of leads at the company asked the question: What would happen if Google users wanted to interact with Google via voice for just 30 seconds a day? And how much compute power would we need to support our users?"" The group determined Google would need to double the number of computers in its data centers. So they looked for a better solution. ""We realized that we could build custom hardware, not general purpose hardware, but custom hardware — Tensor Processing Units in this case — to support that much, much more efficiently. In fact, a factor of 100 more efficiently than it would have been otherwise,"" Vahdat said. Google data centers still rely on general-purpose central processing units, or CPUs, and Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Google's TPUs are a different type of chip called an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, which are custom-built for specific purposes. The TPU is focused on AI. Google makes another ASIC focused on video called a Video Coding Unit. Google also makes custom chips for its devices, similar to Apple's custom silicon strategy. The Tensor G4 powers Google's new AI-enabled Pixel 9, and its new A1 chip powers Pixel Buds Pro 2. The TPU, however, is what set Google apart. It was the first of its kind when it launched in 2015. Google TPUs still dominate among custom cloud AI accelerators, with 58% of the market share, according to The Futurum Group. Google coined the term based on the algebraic term ""tensor,"" referring to the large-scale matrix multiplications that happen rapidly for advanced AI applications. With the second TPU release in 2018, Google expanded the focus from inference to training and made them available for its cloud customers to run workloads, alongside market-leading chips such as Nvidia's GPUs. ""If you're using GPUs, they're more programmable, they're more flexible. But they've been in tight supply,"" said Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst covering semiconductors at Bernstein Research. The AI boom has sent Nvidia's stock through the roof, catapulting the chipmaker to a $3 trillion market cap in June, surpassing Alphabet and jockeying with Apple and Microsoft for position as the world's most valuable public company. ""Being candid, these specialty AI accelerators aren't nearly as flexible or as powerful as Nvidia's platform, and that is what the market is also waiting to see: Can anyone play in that space?"" Newman said. Now that we know Apple's using Google's TPUs to train its AI models, the real test will come as those full AI features roll out on iPhones and Macs next year.

Broadcom and TSMC

It's no small feat to develop alternatives to Nvidia's AI engines. Google's sixth generation TPU, called Trillium, is set to come out later this year.

Google showed CNBC the sixth version of its TPU, Trillium, in Mountain View, California, on July 23, 2024. Trillium is set to come out later in 2024. Marc Ganley

""It's expensive. You need a lot of scale,"" Rasgon said. ""And so it's not something that everybody can do. But these hyperscalers, they've got the scale and the money and the resources to go down that path."" The process is so complex and costly that even the hyperscalers can't do it alone. Since the first TPU, Google's partnered with Broadcom , a chip developer that also helps Meta design its AI chips. Broadcom says it's spent more than $3 billion to make these partnerships happen. ""AI chips — they're very complex. There's lots of things on there. So Google brings the compute,"" Rasgon said. ""Broadcom does all the peripheral stuff. They do the I/O and the SerDes, all of the different pieces that go around that compute. They also do the packaging."" Then the final design is sent off for manufacturing at a fabrication plant, or fab — primarily those owned by the world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , which makes 92% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. When asked if Google has any safeguards in place should the worst happen in the geopolitical sphere between China and Taiwan, Vahdat said, ""It's certainly something that we prepare for and we think about as well, but we're hopeful that actually it's not something that we're going to have to trigger."" Protecting against those risks is the primary reason the White House is handing out $52 billion in CHIPS Act funding to companies building fabs in the U.S. — with the biggest portions going to Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to date.

Processors and power

Risks aside, Google just made another big chip move, announcing its first general-purpose CPU, Axion, will be available by the end of the year.

""If Buffett likes round numbers, he may not be planning to sell any additional shares of Apple,"" said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. ""Just as Coca-Cola is a 'permanent' holding for Buffett, so may be Apple.""

It's prompted some to believe that the 'Oracle of Omaha' is done selling down his stake in the iPhone maker.

Many Buffett followers made the curious observation after a regulatory ""13-F"" filing Wednesday night revealed Berkshire Hathaway 's equity holdings at the end of the second quarter. It showed an identical 400 million share count in Apple and Coca-Cola, Buffett's oldest and longest stock position.

A coincidence or master plan? Warren Buffett now owns the exact same number of shares of Apple as he does Coca-Cola after slashing the tech holding by half.

The 93-year-old legendary investor first bought 14,172,500 shares of Coca-Cola in 1988 and increased his stake over the next few years to 100 million shares by 1994. So the investor has kept his Coca-Cola stake steady at essentially the same round-number share count for 30 years.

Due to two rounds of 2-for-1 stock splits in 2006 and 2012, Berkshire's Coca-Cola holding became 400 million shares.

Buffett said he discovered the iconic soft drink when he was only 6 years old. In 1936, Buffett started buying Cokes six at a time for 25 cents each from his family grocery store to sell around the neighborhood for five cents more. Buffett said it was then he realized the ""extraordinary consumer attractiveness and commercial possibilities of the product.""

Slashing Apple stake

Investing in tech high-flyers such as Apple appears to defy Buffett's long-held value investing principles, but the famed investor has treated it as a consumer products company like Coca-Cola rather than a technology investment.

Buffett has touted the loyal customer base of the iPhone, saying people would give up their cars before they give up their smartphones. He even called Apple the second-most important business after Berkshire's cluster of insurers.

So it was shocking to some when it was revealed that Berkshire dumped more than 49% of its stake in the iPhone maker in the second quarter.

Many suspected that it was part of portfolio management or a bigger overall market view, and not a judgement on the future prospects of Apple. The sale brought down Apple's weighting in Berkshire's portfolio to about 30% from almost 50% at the end of last year.

And with it settled at this round number, it appears to be in a spot that Buffett favors for his most cherished and longest-held equities.

Still, some said it could just be a pure coincidence.

""I don't think Buffett thinks that way,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder.

But at Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett did compare the two and reference the holding period for both was unlimited.

""We own Coca-Cola, which is a wonderful business,"" Buffett said. ""And we own Apple, which is an even better business, and we will own, unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola."""

Google announced new Pixel phones, watches and AI technology.

During Google's Pixel phone launch on Tuesday, a product director named David Citron took the stage to show off the mobile capabilities of the company's new AI assistant, Gemini. Things got awkward right after the presenter told the audience, ""all the demos today are live, by the way.""

In front of a big crowd of media and analysts at Google's Silicon Valley headquarters and about 100,000 viewers on YouTube, Citron took a photo of a concert poster and asked the assistant to check his calendar to see if he's free the night pop star Sabrina Carpenter is playing in San Francisco.

The demo failed, freezing up and displaying an error message. Citron tried again, with the same result. After a quick verbal appeal to the ""demo gods,"" and a phone swap, the third try worked.

""Sure, I found that Sabrina Carpenter is coming to San Francisco on November 9, 2024,"" the assistant wrote in a message that popped up on Citron's screen. ""I don't see any events on your calendar during that time.""

While the incident was brief and buggy, the demo highlighted one of Google's advantages as artificial intelligence features make their way deeper into smartphone software. Rivals are preparing consumers for a future of AI, but Google's Gemini features are real and are shipping — at least for testing purposes — now.

In June, Apple presented a prerecorded video, rather than a live demo, to showcase its assistant Siri's forthcoming leap in capability to take actions and understand context under its new AI system called Apple Intelligence.

Apple Intelligence is currently in testing for developers, but some of its most critical improvements, including image generation, integration with ChatGPT and key advancements for its assistant Siri, haven't yet officially come out of Apple's labs.

OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI boom with ChatGPT, also often reveals AI advancements but strictly limits the number of people who can test them.

""I think what's new is that we've moved from the mode of, like projecting a vision of where things are headed to, like, actual shipping product,"" Rick Osterloh, Google devices chief, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa on Tuesday.

Google's live demos mark a shift from late last year, when the company tried to show off Gemini in a demonstration, and ended up getting roundly criticized for editing the video.

""What we were showing today is the stuff that is shipping in the next few days or weeks, and that's really critical,"" Osterloh said. ""For a lot of the things that other companies have announced, they're really not available to many people. This is going to be available to millions of people very soon.""

After Apple's announcement in June, the company did some scripted live testing with media and analysts for Apple Intelligence on current devices. In July, Apple released a preview of some Apple Intelligence functions for developers, including the ability to generate summaries as well as a new look for Siri that makes the entire iPhone screen glow. However, the preview doesn't include functions like image generation, ChatGPT integration and the most anticipated improvements to Siri which will enable it to perform tasks naturally.

Google's kickoff on Tuesday could put renewed pressure on Apple, as the two smartphone market leaders race to integrate AI into their operating systems. IDC estimates that ""Gen AI"" capable smartphones — phones with the chips and memory needed to run AI — will more than quadruple in units sold in 2024 to about 234 million devices.

""We got an idea today of what Apple is competing with,"" Grace Harmon, analyst at eMarketer, said in an interview.

With generative AI moving to phones, the market is also going to see a shift in AI processing. Instead of sophisticated models that emulate human output being run in huge Nvidia -based data centers, AI features for devices will rely on simpler functions like summarization or fluency, mainly running on the chips already inside the devices.

In Google's 100-minute presentation Tuesday, the company showed several capabilities that aren't yet available elsewhere.

Citron's example — asking questions about the contents of a poster in a photo — highlights a technical advancement called ""multimodal AI,"" which isn't a planned Apple capability.

The company introduced a feature that lets users take screenshots of what they're viewing, and Google will compile that information into notes that can be quickly searched later.

Google's most important presentation on Tuesday was Gemini Live, its next-generation assistant. In the demo, the technology was able to chat naturally, like a person, adding items to shopping lists or checking Google calendars. Soon, it will be able to help a user do deep research, Osterloh said on stage. Google executives attributed the capabilities to ""decades of investment"" in AI and its ""integrated AI strategy.""

At one point, Google said its AI was a ""complete end-to-end experience that only Google can deliver,"" a tweak to a phrase that's long come from Apple. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, is fond of saying that ""only Apple"" can create its products because of its expertise integrating hardware and software.

In a press release, Google took a shot at Apple's forthcoming integration with ChatGPT, which is expected before the end of the year. The company said Apple's approach is less private than Google's, because Gemini ""doesn't require hand-off to a third-party AI provider you may not know or trust."""

While these features will roll out slowly, with regions such as China and Europe initially not receiving access , Apple could charge a subscription for the more advanced apps, analysts said.

The Cupertino giant plans to rollout Apple Intelligence , its forthcoming AI system, across some of its devices later this year.

Apple could charge its users up to $20 for its advanced artificial intelligence features, analysts told CNBC, as the company looks to boost the growth of its lucrative services business.

Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, said investment in AI is expensive and Apple will want to pass that cost onto its users.

""Software and services makes it more lucrative for Apple to pass it on with the Apple One subscription model,"" Shah told CNBC in an interview last week.

Apple One costs $19.95 a month and gives users access to various Apple services including Apple Music.

Shah said Apple could charge between $10 and $20 for Apple Intelligence, potentially as part of Apple One, for more premium AI features.

Apple's services division brought in $24.2 billion in the June quarter, making it unique as many other hardware firms have not managed to monetize software.

""Apple is one of the few connected devices companies that has successfully monetized the value-added services it offers,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC this week.

""As a result, it has set a precedent with its users that they have to pay for more premium services. On this basis, it can't be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering.""

Wood added that Apple Intelligence could give the U.S. giant an option to launched a bundled subscription service with various services under a single price.

""But equally Apple will be reluctant to dilute revenue from individual products subscriptions,"" he said.

It is not unusual for technology firms to charge for their AI offerings. OpenAI, for example has a subscription fee for more advanced ChatGPT features and Microsoft charges for its AI Copilot tool.

Apple's biggest rival Samsung, which has already begun rolling out its artificial intelligence services known as Galaxy AI, is still considering various revenue models for its software, its mobile boss told CNBC last month.

For Apple, AI gives the company a chance to further lock in its already loyal customer base, according to Shah, because Apple Intelligence will learn from a user's behavior and become more personalized.

""The beauty of AI is as you use [it] more and more, it learns about you, and you get locked into the model itself because you can't bring your own model from Apple to Android,"" Shah said.

""That is where you start using more and more, you get used to it more and that is where Apple monetization hits."""

A federal U.S. judge on Monday ruled Google has created an illegal monopoly in the internet search market by erecting barriers to entry for competitors and creating deals that helped to keep it on top. The court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies. At the heart of the case is Google's exclusive relationship with device makers to be the default search engine on their screens. That includes Apple's iPhone and iPad products. Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 alone for the privilege, according to recent court documents. The court said these partnerships helped to fend off rivals in the search space and extend its dominance. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company plans to appeal the court's decision. ""This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,"" Walker wrote in a statement. ""As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use."" Wall Street was quick to weigh in on the ruling. Barclays analysts, for example, said both Google and Apple are losers from the decision, noting the former is in a ""more precarious position than investors think as they start losing these defaults."" Apple, they said, will accrue massive costs if the company ditches Google in order to launch its own service. Barclays analysts said the outcome could be similar to when Google lost a similar deal with Firefox to Yahoo eight years ago, when Google's share dropped from 90% to 60% to 70% and never got back above that higher end of the range. ""Google's own internal projections suggest that it would only claw back 30% of lost iOS mobile queries,"" the analysts wrote. ""This is likely to be a real problem if Apple were to be forced into the search business."" Jim Cramer, however, argued that the ruling is ""better for [Google parent] Alphabet than people think."" This is because the tech behemoth would not have to dish out a giant check to Apple as it has for years, cutting back on substantial costs for the company. But most experts, including Jim, said if the ruling is upheld — and a potential remedy is that Google has to stop making these kinds of search agreements with Apple — it erases an important revenue stream for Apple. Google's annual payment to Apple is considered part of the company's high-margin services business, which has enabled Apple stock to fetch a higher earnings multiple in recent years and lately helped offset weakness in device sales. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance ""By collateral damage of course, this is negative for Apple,"" Jim said. ""They did nothing other than have a really good system."" However, he added: ""Would I sell Apple on this? Well, no."" Bank of America analysts tried to assuage Apple investors' concerns around services revenues. It's not all gloom and doom for Apple if Google cuts back on that annual payment because the iPhone maker still gets money from traffic generated on its devices. ""If the courts ultimately prevent Google from paying to remain the default, Apple might lose this portion of the annual payment; however, we still expect a revenue share agreement for the traffic that Apple generates,"" the analysts wrote in a Tuesday note. Jim said investors shouldn't expect any near-term financial impact on either business. ""It's not like right now Alphabet is going to say to Apple, 'We're not going to pay you anymore. Good luck.' That doesn't happen,"" he said. GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet (GOOGL) year-to-date performance Some Wall Street analysts echoed the Club's sentiments. Bank of America said that Apple ""may not feel the impact of any change for years"" because of the appeal process. The analysts also reiterated their buy rating on Apple shares. Investors seem to be shrugging off the news, at least so far. Alphabet is up 0.44% on Tuesday, while Apple traded flat in the afternoon. Alphabet and Apple shares declined over 4% and 6%, respectively, on Monday. The moves lower, however, were likely due to the broader market sell-off.

Warren Buffett sent shockwaves through the investing world over the weekend by slashing his big Apple stake by half, causing the tech stock to crater on Monday amid the intensifying global sell-off.

Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in its earnings filing that its Apple holding was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, indicating that the Oracle of Omaha dumped a little more than 49% of the tech stake.

Shares of Apple dropped more than 7% in premarket trading Monday. Global stock markets are on the brink of a major correction, triggered by concerns of an economic slowdown.

The 93-year-old legendary investor has been on a massive selling spree, offloading more than $75 billion in equities in the second quarter and raising Berkshire's cash pile to a whopping $277 billion, an all-time high for the conglomerate. Buffett also started selling his second biggest holding Bank of America in July."

The Omaha-based conglomerate disclosed in its earnings filing that its holding in the iPhone maker was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, suggesting that the Oracle of Omaha offloaded a little more than 49% of the tech stake. Even after the selling Apple remains the largest stock stake by far for Berkshire.

Buffett trimmed the Apple stake by 13% in the first quarter and hinted at the Berkshire annual meeting in May that it was for tax reasons. Buffett noted that selling ""a little Apple"" this year would benefit Berkshire shareholders in the long run if the tax on capital gains is raised down the road by a U.S. government wanting to plug a climbing fiscal deficit.

But the magnitude of this selling suggests it could be more than just a tax-saving move.

After declining in the first quarter on concerns it was falling behind on artificial intelligence innovation, Apple shares took off in the second quarter, gaining 23% to a new record as it gave more detail to investors about its future in artificial intelligence.

It won't be clear exactly why Buffett is selling down the holding Berkshire first bought more than eight years ago, whether company reasons, market valuation or because of portfolio management concerns (Buffett typically doesn't want a single holding to grow too large). Berkshire's Apple holding was once so big that it took up half of its equity portfolio."

Revenue in Apple's fiscal third quarter, which ended in June, grew 5% year-over-year to a record of $85.78 billion – ahead of the LSEG estimate of $84.53 billion. Earnings per share rose 11% to $1.40 – above the $1.35 LSEG consensus estimate. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD Shares of Apple dropped as much as 2.7% in after-hours trading before fighting their way back to positive territory. The stock closed the regular session down 1.7% in Thursday's rough market. Bottom line In addition to strong overall sales and profit, Services revenue in fiscal Q3 set a new all-time high. Apple once again achieved a record installed base of active devices, across all geographies and product categories. All of that translated into a healthy companywide gross margin, keeping the tech giant on a strong footing as it prepares to unveil its new AI-enabled iPhone next month. While Greater China remained a weak spot, sales in the region were down only 6.5% year-over-year, representing an improvement from the dismal first half of the year. On the post-earnings call, management said China was down less than 3% on a constant currency basis, meaning foreign exchange headwinds accounted for more than half of the quarterly decline. According to a survey from analytics provider Kantar, iPhones were the top three models sold in urban China during the quarter. Apple Why we own it: Apple's dominant hardware and growing services businesses provide a deep competitive moat and plenty of bundling opportunities. Management's so-called net cash neutral strategy provides confidence that free cash flow will continue to fund dividends and buybacks. Plus, the company's commitment to the customer experience has translated to industry-leading user loyalty scores, giving it pricing power. There's a reason it's one of only two ""own it, don't trade it"" stocks in the portfolio. Most recent buy : April 8, 2014 Initiation : Dec. 2, 2013 During the call, CEO Tim Cook discussed Apple Intelligence at length. The company is clearly excited and optimistic about the opportunity of generative AI and what it means for its ecosystem. He said, ""We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential."" While we know users will need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to leverage the upcoming AI software features, we have yet to see the iPhone 16 and all the hardware upgrades it will bring. Apple typically unveils its new iPhones in September. Since the company's fiscal fourth quarter ends in September, we likely won't see the full financial benefits from sales of new devices. That won't come until Apple's fiscal 2025 first quarter, the holiday period ending in December. However, the expected AI-driven boom in new iPhone sales does represent a clear positive catalyst on the near-term horizon. So, we continue to believe investors should patiently ""own, not trade"" shares and use weakness in the stock as an opportunity to build positions ahead of the upgrade cycle. We're reiterating our $240-per-share price target and maintaining our 2 rating. Apple shares, which are down about 8% from last month's all-time high above $237, have fared better in the painful market rotation of late away from tech stocks. Quarterly commentary The cost of sales line-item was higher than expected in the quarter. But that's to be expected given the sales beat. Companywide profitability was solid with gross margin in the quarter of 46.3%, an expansion of 174 basis points, or 1.74 percentage points, from a year ago, and just better than expected. While product gross margin came up a bit short, the miss was more than offset by extremely strong profitability in Services. Research & Development expenses were a bit elevated, but they were more than offset by lower-than-expected Selling, General & Administrative expenses. Given the AI opportunity Apple has in front of it, we're more than happy to let them spend a bit more on R & D. That's even more true considering that the company is a cash printing machine, with operating cash flow and free cash flow coming in strong for the quarter and supporting capital returns to shareholders over time. Apple exited fiscal Q3 with roughly $153 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet. After subtracting $101 billion of debt, we're left with a net cash position of about $52 billion. Apple has a policy of being net cash neutral over time, meaning that if the cash isn't used for acquisitions or organic growth investments, it is returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the reported quarter, Apple gave back over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and another $26 billion via the repurchase of 139 million shares. Products iPhone sales were down slightly in the quarter. However, they were up on a constant currency basis. CFO Luca Maestri said on the call that iPhones ""set June quarter records across several countries including the U.K., Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines."" MacBook Air with the M3 chip drove laptop results during the quarter, with Maestri saying that ""half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter"" were new to the device. iPad unit sales benefited from the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air, with Maestri saying that ""half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product."" The Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment was down year-over-year as the Watch and AirPods faced difficult comparisons. However, the result was better-than-expected and points to a sequential acceleration. ""Apple Watch continues to attract new customers with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high,"" Maestri said. Services All-time revenue record, with an all-time record set in developed markets and a June quarter record set in emerging markets. Paid subscriptions grew double digits to a new all-time high, with Maestri saying that ""both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high."" Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on its platform. That's more than double the number from just four years ago. On the call, Cook said, ""We achieved revenue records in the majority of the Services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment Services."" The record installed base of hardware certainly bodes well for Services revenue. However, we were also pleased to hear Maestri say that the company is seeing ""increased customer engagement with our Services offerings."" Guidance September quarter guidance assumes no worsening of the macroeconomic outlook. Revenue in fiscal Q4 is expected to increase at a rate similar to what we saw in the June quarter – which was 5% year-over-year despite a currency headwind of 1.5 percentage points. That compares to the Street's estimate of 4.3% growth. So, call it in line to slightly better than expected. Services are expected to grow at a double-digit rate similar to the rate seen in Apple's fiscal 2024 first quarter. We got 11.3% year-over-year growth in that quarter, and the Street is looking for 10.9% in the September quarter. So, the guide here also appears to be in line to slightly better. Gross margin is projected to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, better than the 45.7% estimate, at the midpoint. Operating expenses are forecast in a range of $14.2 billion to $14.4 billion, better than the $14.56 billion estimate. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL.

Apple's third quarter, which ends in June, is traditionally the company's slowest quarter of the year by sales.

This year, the ""main event"" won't be Apple's earnings, wrote Barclays analyst Tim Long, it's what the company says about the September quarter, which is nearly one-third over.

Here's what Wall Street expects from Apple, according to LSEG consensus estimates:

Earnings per share : $1.35

: $1.35 Revenue : $84.53 billion

: $84.53 billion Q4 revenue guidance: $93.39 billion

Here are estimates for Apple's major product lines, according to StreetAccount:

iPhone revenue : $38.64 billion

: $38.64 billion Mac revenue : $7.04 billion

: $7.04 billion iPad revenue : $6.61 billion

: $6.61 billion Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue : $7.83 billion

: $7.83 billion Services revenue: $24.05 billion

While Apple doesn't provide official guidance, it gives investors a number of data points that speak to how the September quarter is shaping up. The company typically releases new iPhones in September, but those revenues usually fall primarily in the December quarter.

""After an almost two-year period with little to no upward estimate revisions, we finally see a better outlook coming for the September quarter,"" Long wrote in a note last month.

Investors will be keen to hear how Apple CEO Tim Cook talks about Apple Intelligence, its long-awaited artificial intelligence play that uses the company's own chips in servers and devices, instead of expensive Nvidia -based cloud computers.

Apple revealed Apple Intelligence in June, and the first preview version of some features was released earlier this week. It isn't likely to be material to Apple's bottom line yet, but could boost ""late cycle"" demand for high-end iPhone 15 models that can run the service, Long wrote.

Some analysts are looking at Apple's capital expenditures, which have been skyrocketing at rivals as they assemble massive server farms for AI. But Apple's strategy to use its own chips in servers appears to be a lower-cost approach.

""Edge AI is in very early stages, has lower capex needs, and offers faster monetization potential through consumer hardware upgrades, which we think makes Apple stock particularly attractive,"" Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note in July.

JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee expects Apple to reassure investors that the coming iPhone replacement cycle will include better-than-expected revenue, thanks to AI. He raised his price target on the stock to $265 last month and has an overweight rating.

""The revenue upside, in turn drives our expectations for EPS upside, which is likely to lead to consensus revisions for full-year earnings, and partly ease investor concerns around a premium valuation multiple,"" Chatterjee wrote.

Apple previously told investors to expect modest overall growth in the fiscal third quarter, with a stronger ""double-digit"" increase in sales in its iPad division, partially due to the release of new iPad models in May. The company also said to expect roughly 14% growth in its profitable Services division, which covers products ranging from iCloud subscriptions to hardware warranties.

Apple's China performance will be under scrutiny, wrote Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan, after sales fell 8% on an annual basis in the second quarter in the face of increased competition from native companies like Huawei.

""Although aggressive promotion during 618 shopping holiday helped improve iPhones sales,"" market estimates from IDC show Apple's sales declined while the Android market grew in China, wrote Citi analyst Atif Malik in a July note."

Apple Intelligence, the company's forthcoming artificial intelligence system, could spur a fresh cycle of iPhone upgrades and hardware sales. But CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri spent a good part of the Q&A portion of the analyst call dodging questions about the pace of Apple's rollout, whether the company is already seeing a sales boost from the service, and Apple's deal with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its software.

One question Cook was willing to partially address was about the company's spending on AI servers. It's an issue that's come up throughout tech earnings season, as investors try to gauge where companies are in their AI infrastructure buildouts and how much more is coming.

Cook acknowledged on the call that costs are on the rise. He gave similar comments to CNBC.

""Embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we're spending for AI and Apple Intelligence,"" Cook told CNBC's Steve Kovach on Thursday.

Apple reported $2.15 billion in payments for property, plant and equipment in the June quarter, up 8% quarter-over-quarter and about 3% from a year earlier. Some of those capital investments aren't for AI, but for other Apple operations.

The rise in Apple's capital expenditure is tiny compared to its mega-cap peers, such as Microsoft, Google , and Meta . Those companies are spending huge sums to build and equip AI-focused data centers with Nvidia chips.

For example, in the June quarter, Microsoft reported $13.87 billion in capital expenditures, according to FactSet, which is a 55% year-over-year increase. Alphabet's expenses jumped 91% to $13.19 billion, while Meta's capital expenditures rose 31% to spent $8.3 billion during the quarter.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has explained this spending surge in game theory terms. He said the risk of missing out on the generative AI boom is larger than the downside of spending too much on graphics processors and servers. Zuckerberg also wants to ensure that Apple won't fully control the next major technology shift, if it turns out to be AI."

Apple – Shares of the iPhone maker slipped nearly 2%, even as the company beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines. Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.40 per share while analysts polled by LSEG called for $1.35 per share. Revenue clocked in at $85.78 billion, also surpassing the Street's estimates.

Intel — The chip stock sank 17%. Intel said it would suspend its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter, and it announced plans to layoff 15% of its workforce. The news coincided with worse-than-expected quarterly results. Intel also shared disappointing guidance for the current quarter.

Amazon - Shares of the e-commerce giant dropped 5% in extended trading. The company reported weaker-than-expected revenue for the second quarter and issued a disappointing forecast for the third quarter. Revenue in its cloud division increased 19% in the second quarter, beating analyst estimates, however.

DoorDash — Shares surged nearly 14% after the online food ordering company reported a revenue beat in the second quarter.

It's now possible for patients with limited physical mobility to control the device using only their thoughts.

Synchron is building a brain-computer interface, or a BCI, designed to help patients with paralysis operate technology like smartphones and computers with their minds. The company has implanted its BCI in six patients in the U.S. and four in Australia. It still needs approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to commercialize its technology more broadly.

Apple released the Vision Pro earlier this year, and users typically control it with eye movements, voice commands and hand gestures. Synchron has been working to make it accessible to patients who can't speak or move their upper limbs.

Synchron CEO Thomas Oxley said he thinks Apple's iOS accessibility platform is best in class, which is why the company has initially focused on helping patients control devices within Apple's ecosystem. He said Synchron will likely work to connect its BCI to other headsets, but it's starting with the Vision Pro.

Apple has been ""very supportive"" of the Vision Pro integration, he added.

""I think BCI is very well placed to add huge value as a synergistic integration into the Apple ecosystem,"" Oxley told CNBC in an interview.

Synchron is a part of an increasingly competitive BCI industry, and the company said Tuesday that it is the first to connect its system to Apple's Vision Pro. Other companies like Paradromics, Precision Neuroscience, Blackrock Neurotech and Elon Musk's Neuralink are also developing BCI systems, though their designs and ambitions all vary.

Synchron's BCI is inserted through a patient's jugular vein, so no open brain surgery is required. It's delivered to the blood vessel that rests on the surface of the brain's motor cortex. The stent-like device is connected to an antenna that sits under the skin in the chest. The antenna collects raw brain data and sends it to external devices.

The company split the Apple Intelligence features from the initial iOS launch due to concerns over their stability and need to run tests on a wider scale, the report said.

Apple previously said its AI features would be released in a beta version this fall, and they're expected to help drive sales of Apple's new iPhones. The features will only work on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration and Siri improvements, are expected to be released later in the year.

Apple plans to give developers early access to Apple Intelligence as soon as this week in the iOS 18.1 beta, Bloomberg said.

The company first announced Apple Intelligence on June 10. The AI features, which will also be available on all Macs and iPads that run the M1 chip or newer, can proofread writing or re-write in a friendly or professional tone, create custom emojis, and summarize and transcribe phone calls.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new software called Apple Intelligence was released in the developer beta of iOS 18.1. It's also available in similar releases for iPad and Mac. It's currently only available to registered Apple developers who pay $99 a year.

In addition, users will have to register for a waitlist inside Apple's settings app after updating to gain access to the service, which involves pinging Apple servers for more complicated requests.

Later this year, it will be released to the public, but the 18.1 version number suggests Apple Intelligence won't be released alongside new iPhone hardware, which is expected to be launched running iOS 18 in the fall.

Apple Intelligence is an important initiative for Apple. Investors hope the tight integration of AI with Apple's operating system can spur a big wave of upgrades in the coming years, especially since the system will only work on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and newer.

Apple's choice of Google's homegrown Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for training was detailed in a technical paper just published by the company. Separately, Apple released a preview version of Apple Intelligence for some devices on Monday.

Nvidia's pricey graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for high-end AI training chips, and have been in such high demand over the past couple years that they've been difficult to procure in the required quantities. OpenAI, Microsoft , and Anthropic are all using Nvidia's GPUs for their models, while other tech companies, including Google, Meta , Oracle and Tesla are snapping them up to build out their AI systems and offerings.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai both made comments last week suggesting that their companies and others in the industry may be overinvesting in AI infrastructure, but acknowledged the business risk of doing otherwise was too high.

""The downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years,"" Zuckerberg said on a podcast with Bloomberg's Emily Chang.

Apple doesn't name Google or Nvidia in its 47-page paper, but did note its Apple Foundation Model (AFM) and AFM server are trained on ""Cloud TPU clusters."" That means Apple rented servers from a cloud provider to perform the calculations.

""This system allows us to train the AFM models efficiently and scalably, including AFM-on-device, AFM-server, and larger models,"" Apple said in the paper.

It was a horrendous paper — don't ask me what I was doing there other than booking a paycheck. My late editor, Don Forst, used to tell me that if I wanted truth, I should be novelist. But I was in newspapers, which meant I did whatever was necessary to sell papers, fighting every minute to try to find a way to tell the truth in the face of a phalanx of editors who knew how to sensationalize no matter what the story. The facts would periodically drift into my copy, and I would be most grateful for the reprieve. The stock market can be like that paper. We say all sorts of things and create all sorts of theses to explain what's driving the action, but eventually the rubber meets the road. That will be the case in this jam-packed week , with the earnings from Microsoft on Tuesday, Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. There's been a whole lot of extrapolation about how these Club holdings are really doing without a lot of facts — not that the facts mattered with either Alphabet or Tesla , both of which failed to disappoint last week, and yet their earnings were greeted with disappointment anyway. I do not mean that cynically. If the so-called ""great rotation"" out of megacap technology stocks into small caps that began earlier in July hadn't been at its zenith, I think both stocks would have rallied. The crucial line for Club name Alphabet was the Google Cloud number, which was much better than expected . The issue with YouTube, whatever the heck it was said to be, made no sense whatsoever. They can't handle how much business they have. And all the spending on the data center to support generative artificial intelligence initiatives? The company is in a jam on this one. If Alphabet said it cut back on data-center spending, then it would be alleged the company is falling behind Amazon and Microsoft in the AI race. Instead, Alphabet said it would keep spending a great deal, so it was blasted as a company with no discipline and certainly no return on investment. The company also is now dogged by another competitor in search engines after ChatGPT creator OpenAI announced a prototype of SearchGPT . Well, that had to happen, didn't it? I will take my chances that the Google franchise maintains its longtime dominance. The reaction to Tesla was just plain weird. Tesla's stock began to soar at the end of June on absolutely nothing. We all knew the electric vehicle maker was going to miss estimates. I mean, what's the big deal? I don't know a soul who thought this quarter would be even remotely in line. But when it wasn't, somehow that was revelatory. I actually liked the call because CEO Elon Musk laid out the longer-term vision, which was great because I didn't care what that longer-term vision was going to be if he didn't stay as chief executive. Now that I know the multiyear plan — autonomous vehicles, solar energy and robots — I am inclined to push the stock hard as it falls. We saw so much bilge extrapolated to the tech titans reporting this week that it will be delightful, at last, to have the facts get in the way of the story. I expect the much-hyped rotation to stay hyped even as we know the truth: Nobody is actually buying the small caps because so many of these companies are pathetic. They are just buying baskets of these stocks, specifically funds tracking the Russell 2000 and S & P 600 . There isn't enough liquidity in these small-cap gauges, so anyone who sells a large amount of megacap tech and goes into these indices makes them look super good. That's going to hang over this week's earnings like a nasty shroud. Then there's the data center sword of Damocles that skewered Alphabet. It can do the same to all of these companies set to report because they also have been writing checks like mad to Club holding Nvidia to secure AI computing resources. I think Microsoft on Tuesday evening might be vulnerable from the cloud side because of Google Cloud's robust growth. Microsoft has to come out and tell a ServiceNow -like story about Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant product. This also will be the first quarter where we have the new AI-infused personal computers. Will Microsoft have say something good about the initial customer response? It's not clear given the way that shares of fellow portfolio name Best Buy have stalled, and Best Buy is the company doing the plurality of the selling of these AI PCs . Still, Microsoft is the stock with the fewest enemies. It stands to reason that it will acquit itself well. The following evening Meta gives us its results. Maybe we can get some clues from CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday during his fireside chat with Nvidia's Jensen Huang at Siggraph, a big graphics conference in Denver. It's a favorite venue of Huang's, and Monday will be truly a remarkable get-together given how not long ago these two CEOs were not that close. Of course, Zuckerberg is shrewd enough to not get in the way of Meta's earnings quiet period, but I think he might explain why he's spending so much on Nvidia hardware, which could take the sting away from an Alphabet-like inquiry on the company's earnings call a few days later. Zuckerberg is a forward-thinking person, so he may actually be able to articulate why he is spending all the money on the data center. Facts, not stories. The digital-ad business is a good one for Zuckerberg. Still, like everyone else in the industry, Meta might be grappling with some drop off in spending from Asian e-commerce giants Temu and Shein, which had been aggressively courting customers abroad . However, this risk has now been pretty well-telegraphed, and I am just hoping for no faux surprises. It's very hard to move the needle for this company given its scale. For example, Zuckerberg has a red-hot property in the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which would be big for just about any company except a tech titan expected to generate almost $160 billion in revenue this year. I wonder if the smart glasses — and the investment Meta might be making in Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica — will even get mentioned on the call. On Friday, shares of EssilorLuxottica had a huge move, which might have stolen some of the upside. Apple reports on Thursday, and if you think the cloud-computing heavyweights are spending on too much AI, then you should be buying Apple. It's basically an AI play without the heavy capital expenditure spending risk. If you buy Apple here, you also are following the traditional thinking that this is the last earnings report before a new iPhone version launches in September, so you want to get in right after the quarter. It's a good story. Amazon is problematic like Alphabet. It's spending a fortune on AI while losing a fortune on its digital assistant Alexa. Sure, there was just a big Prime Day event that featured steep discounts on a lot of items. However, Wall Street doesn't care about that. It wants to hear a clearly articulated story about why Amazon is so enamored with AI. I think CEO Andy Jassy and Co. will have something good to say, or at least a decent story. But it feels tired, in need of something new. I just don't think a strong Amazon Web Services number will do the trick. All of these stocks are fighting another enemy now, besides data-center spending fears and the small-cap run: the Federal Reserve. As it dawns on people that the Fed will cuts soon, any sign that there may be a housing recovery — even if there isn't one materializing yet — will be met with buying in stocks that benefit from that development. Just consider three of the biggest gainers in Friday's session: Mohawk Industries , the carpet company; Fortune Brands Innovations , the high-end home accessory business; and DeWalt parent Stanley Black & Decker , which we own for the Club. The first two reported OK earnings, and their stocks still took off because the companies showed discipline, which will turn into operating leverage when the rate-cutting cycle begins. As for Stanley Black & Decker, we sold some into Friday's strength because we don't want to get skunked by a bad quarter Tuesday morning. Basically, we wanted a smaller position until we have a better sense of how the toolmaker intends to capitalize off the moment. Over the past few quarters, I thought management would tell a good story as we waited for the housing market to turn, but it hasn't so far. I don't know why, but we have to keep these guys on a short leash: We don't want to discover facts that get in the way of the Fed rate cut cycle. The strength in anything home makes us unsure about how in heck all of the government debt can be so easily absorbed. Right now, it's been spectacular for bonds as yields trend lower, which keeps the housing-related story on track. You need both low bond yields and lots of rate-cut chatter to make this part of the market get momentum. It's got something to build on. The megacap techs, on the other hand, do not have something to build on after this recent rotation. They have not been able to lose their whipping-boy status. Maybe this week could be the week that it happens. Random musings I want to briefly address a few more topics before the busy week of earnings officially arrives. Contrary to the numerous press reports about my supposed ""endorsing"" of Vice President Kamala Harris, I want to repeat where I stand about the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination through the lens of investing in the stock market: The former California senator — whose brother-in-law, Tony West, is the chief legal officer of Uber Technologies — has real contacts among the tech titans. President Joe Biden always chose to have his agencies wear down tech companies. He appointed to key roles at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission antitrust attack dogs who have it in for tech. Unless Harris specifically says her hypothetical administration would change nothing about its approach, I believe it's hard to be more disdainful of tech than Biden, who truly did not care about these companies other than to try to break them up or prosecute them. I believe Harris will be more practical, if only because she knows so many of them and can talk to them face to face. Biden couldn't. Biden's main conduit to the business world has been Gina Raimondo, the brilliant head of the Department of Commerce. Notably, Raimondo said she expected Harris to be on board with the semiconductor manufacturing build out in the U.S. because she had expressed so. But the most important part of the Wall Street debate when it comes to Harris versus Republican nominee Donald Trump is the shocking antagonism Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has against Big Tech. Vance uses old-fashioned populist rhetoric against corporations, and he is no friend of the tech titans. The idea that the Republican Party is uniformly pro-business has become more complicated. The tariff proposals that Trump has floated could really hurt business. And Trump's recent comments about Taiwan paying the U.S. for defense that raised questions about his support for the self-governed island and chipmaking hub? That was music to Chinese President Xi Jinping's ears. It would also make me change my stance toward owning and not trading Nvidia because the company would not be able to get the chips it needs if the Chinese make a move on Taiwan. What a reckless statement. That's why I said if you own a lot of international companies and tech stocks and want to vote to help your portfolio, Harris is more likely to help those firms than hurt them. I want to point out that what I didn't say was that if you wanted to vote your paycheck, you should vote Trump, especially if you are wealthy, because he wants to cut your taxes. His help for you when it comes to taxes is as profound as I expect Harris to be when it comes to tech. And now I need to mention this nearly $500 million verdict against Club holding Abbott Laboratories over allegations that it failed to disclose the risks of its specialized infant formula. I know I repeatedly warned about this case, but I am stunned about the size of the damages handed down Friday. Abbott said it would try to have the verdict overturned. But the case was handled in St. Louis, Missouri, the worst venue for defendant drug companies. I am very concerned by this decision not just as an Abbott shareholder, but as an American. The Food and Drug Administration needs to step up here because this was an outrage, and Abbott must pull its formulas for premature infants now because it only makes $9 million a year on them. What a travesty our country has become when it comes to suing companies. But I don't expect Biden's agencies to get behind Abbott. They are pretty much in league with the plaintiff's bar on everything. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GOOGL, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, META, MSFT, SWK and ABT.

Apple was edged out of the top five smartphone vendors' list in China in the second quarter, as competition from domestic brands such as Huawei intensifies, according to a Canalys report.

Apple's market share in China shrank to 14% in the second quarter, the report released Thursday showed, from 15% in the first quarter and 16% in the same period a year ago.

The iPhone maker, which was the third-largest smartphone vendor in the second quarter last year, dropped to the sixth spot with about 9.7 million in shipments, according to CNBC calculations.

""It is the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,"" said Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys.

Apple's shipments have been declining since the first quarter when they dropped 25% year on year to 10 million units.

""Chinese vendors' strategies for high-end products and their deep collaboration with local supply chains are starting to pay off in hardware and software features. Honor's latest Magic V3, which leverages GenAI, has significantly enhanced the user experience of foldable devices,"" Zhong added.

On the other hand, Apple is facing a ""bottleneck"" in the Chinese market as it aims to ""stabilize retail prices and protect margins of channel partners,"" he said.

Localization of Apple Intelligence services in China will be an important move in the next 12 months, Canalys said, as Chinese brands are aggressively incorporating generative AI into their products."

The quarterly results from the iPhone maker are always important, but they won't determine what's next for the stock. It's a weird time for Apple, whose stock started 2024 as one of the most hated on Wall Street coming out of last year's tech boom. It regained its luster ahead of better-than-feared earnings in May and last month's artificial intelligence announcement. Apple has held up much better than its Big Tech counterparts in the painful market rotation that began July 11. When Apple delivers fiscal third-quarter numbers after Thursday's closing bell, analysts expect the iPhone maker to report a revenue increase of nearly 3% to $84.36 billion and an earnings-per-share (EPS) gain of more than 6% to $1.34. It's the last quarter before the new iPhone is unveiled, which has seasonably been a slow time for upgrades. Apple usually introduces the next iteration of its flagship device in September. This year's third-quarter dynamic, however, is being compounded by what we already learned at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10 — that the company's new Apple Intelligence features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro model or better. That means buyers who might have made purchases in the past few months have another reason to wait and see what the new AI-enhanced iPhone has to offer. In the past, would-be buyers may have delayed their purchases to see what incremental upgrades the next model would bring. But this year, they know for a fact that the new iPhone will get them access to Apple Intelligence and then some, such as a better camera. That's why the reported fiscal Q3 results from Apple, as important as they are, won't be as important to investors as what management has to say about the current quarter — the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September. Any commentary on initial interest in Apple Intelligence will determine where shares go next. As of Wednesday, Apple stock gained about 13% year to date — just shy of the S & P 500 's 2024 performance. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD Analysts at Barclays, who maintain a sell-equivalent on Apple due to an elevated valuation, believe that fiscal Q3 strength in services and MacBooks, thanks to an easy comp, will be offset by weakness in wearables. They think that iPhone and iPad sales will largely match expectations. In line with the Club's view on what matters, Barclays said, ""We think the Sep-Q guidance is the main event as investors care less on June-Q results due to the tail end of the IP15 cycle, but ultimately the reception of the iPhone 16 and AI features will dictate performance."" We have a wait-for-a-pullback 2 rating on Apple ahead of what's expected to be the biggest iPhone upgrade cycle in years. Barclays analysts also looked at average hold times and the percentage of installed base upgrading for each iPhone generation starting with the iPhone 6. The average hold time was 2.4 years back when the iPhone 6 was launched. That cycle has now expanded to 5.6 years. The percentage of the installed base upgrading has fallen to a low of 18%, though units sold have largely held in around the 200 million range thanks to a growing installed base. That's intriguing because, given the lengthened upgrade cycle, it's a fortuitous time for Apple to release new cutting-edge features to prompt refreshes. Analysts on Wall Street are now trying to work into their models the degree to which hold times might shorten and the percentage of users getting new devices might increase. Despite its sell rating on Apple shares, Barclays highlighted supplier checks that point to a ""slight uptick to iPhone builds, which translates to 52M iPhone unit shipment, above Street consensus of 49M units."" JPMorgan is far more bullish on what's to come for Apple, reiterating its overweight buy rating and establishing a December 2025 price target of $265 per share, up from their December 2024 target of $245. Apple shares were trading around $218 late Wednesday. The analysts also believe the soon-to-be-announced quarter is likely going to be overshadowed by what Apple has to say about the September quarter and what it unveils with the iPhone 16. JPMorgan sees a higher mix of services revenue, increased upgrade volumes — even if the rate of upgrades remains low, thanks to the larger installed base — and the potential for Apple Intelligence to surprise consumers and ""drive a secular increase in the replacement rate."" That differs from the Barclays analysts' read on the situation. ""We do not think the iPhone16/AI features will be enough to drive a meaningful enough upgrade cycle to justify the valuation,"" Barclays analysts wrote. There's no denying that Apple's multiple is elevated. However, we tend to agree with JPMorgan that the direct benefits of iPhone upgrades, along with the more indirect benefits — such as the potential for AI to drive new service offerings and boost App Store downloads — provide support for the higher multiple. Bottom line We may still be in the early days of generative AI. But one thing becoming increasingly clear — more important even than the large language models themselves — is the data on which they are trained. So, by that logic, it's the company with the most personalized data and the ability to apply that data to its models that can offer up the most personalized generative AI assistant. We are hard-pressed to find a company better positioned than Apple to offer up a personalized generative AI experience. After all, what knows more about our daily schedules, tastes in music, event plans, travels, geolocation, and family gatherings than our phones? The bull/bear debate on Apple depends on whether the benefits of Apple Intelligence are ""priced in"" at current levels. As ""own it, don't trade it"" Apple bulls, we don't think the implications and ripple effects of Apple's AI efforts are being fully appreciated. Yes, the iPhone will be the greatest, most direct way for Apple to realize financial benefits from Apple Intelligence in the near term. The opportunity for Apple becomes much larger as the company works to integrate AI throughout its ecosystem of devices and services. That, in our view, represents a multiyear opportunity that will translate beyond hardware into high-margin services revenue growth, and therefore support the elevated multiple.

The mineral-rich east of DR Congo has seen years of conflict often fuelled by what lies underneath the ground

The authorities in France and Belgium will now look at whether there is enough evidence to take the legal action further.

In its 2023 review of the issue , Apple said it monitors its supply chain and works to mitigate risks as well as improving measures to trace the source of minerals.

Acting on behalf of the Congolese government, lawyers have argued that Apple is complicit in crimes committed by armed groups that control some of the mines in the east of DR Congo.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using conflict minerals.

In a statement, the lawyers for the DR Congo talked about Apple's supply chain being contaminated with ""blood minerals"".

They allege that the tin, tantalum and tungsten is taken from conflict areas and then ""laundered through international supply chains"".

""These activities have fuelled a cycle of violence and conflict by financing militias and terrorist groups and have contributed to forced child labour and environmental devastation.""

Apple has not responded to a BBC request for comment, but in its report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission detailing its actions on this issue in 2023, the company highlights the measures it has taken to ensure that it is not using conflict minerals.

""Although Apple does not directly purchase, procure, or source primary minerals, we are committed to meeting and exceeding internationally accepted due diligence standards for primary minerals and recycled materials in our supply chain,"" it said.

As a result, all those involved in the supply chain have to participate in an ""independent third-party conflict minerals audit"". Apple said that in 2023 it removed 14 ""smelters and refiners"" that would not participate or did not meet the requirements for responsible sourcing.

The east of DR Congo is a major source of minerals and the global thirst for them has fuelled wars there for decades.

Rights groups have long alleged that large quantities of minerals from legitimate mines, as well as from facilities run by armed groups, are transported to neighbouring Rwanda and end up in our phones and computers.

Rwanda has in the past described the Congolese government's legal action against Apple as a media stunt.

It has denied selling any conflict minerals to the tech company."

Apple has been told to pay back €13bn (£11bn; $14bn) in unpaid taxes to Ireland by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The EU Commission accused Ireland of giving Apple illegal tax advantages eight years ago but the Irish government has consistently argued against the need for the tax to be paid back. “The Court of Justice gives final judgment in the matter and confirms the European Commission’s 2016 decision: Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover,” the court said.

With business slumping, Apple has been under pressure to show what it will offer buyers to jumpstart a new wave of iPhone sales. On Monday, the technology giant revealed its hand - the iPhone 16 which has a camera button on the outside of the handset. The button is an external clue to the changes Apple said it had made inside its latest smartphone, aimed at harnessing the latest in artificial intelligence (AI). Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said the upgrades would ""push the boundaries of what a smartphone can do"" but the firm has tough competition, as other brands have already integrated generative AI features into their handsets.

Apple's share price fell during its ""Glowtime"" event, where it unveiled the iPhone 16 as well as other products, and ended the day flat. The company, worth $3 trillion, is facing concern that it is losing its edge in the burgeoning area of artificial intelligence. Sales of the iPhone - Apple's most important product which accounts for around half of its total sales - have stalled in recent months. They slipped by 1% over the nine months ended 29 June compared with a year earlier. Apple said its new phones, which come with longer lasting batteries, more powerful chips and enhanced privacy features, were its first built specifically to handle AI and its new ""Apple Intelligence"" tools, many of which were announced in June. Those include new tools for writing and creating new emojis as well incorporating OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT into Siri to help users with some queries and text generation requests. On Monday, Apple also announced updates to its Apple Watch and its AirPod headphones, which will allow them to automatically drop the volume when users start in-person conversations and to decline calls with the shake of a head. It said the Pro version of its AirPods would be able to be used as a ""clinical grade"" personal hearing aid for people with mild or moderate hearing loss. The company said it was expecting marketing approval from regulators for the device ""soon"" and the feature would be available this autumn in more than 100 countries, including the US, Germany and Japan. Previously, the company had a feature that allowed people to pair hearing aids with iPhones and other devices. The products were rolled out at a glossy event where protestors gathered in a designated free speech area across the street, urging executives to ramp up efforts to protect children from dangerous content in the company’s App Store. The protest featured a life-sized blow-up made to resemble Mr Cook.

Sales of the new range start in September, with prices for the iPhone16 starting at $799. But the Apple Intelligence features are not set to be available on operating systems until October, starting in the US and heading to other countries in the following months. They will be available in the UK in December. Ben Wood, chief analyst at the market research firm CCS Insight, said it was likely that many people would dismiss the company's new camera control as a ""glorified shutter button"". But he said it offered ""very significant"" upgrades, including visual, AI-powered search and he came away from the presentation persuaded that Apple would win over customers. ""The combination of Apple Intelligence and new camera features on the iPhone 16 will help spur upgrades from loyal Apple customers,"" he said. ""Particularly as Apple is positioning this latest update as being a future-proof purchase for customers wanting to get Apple Intelligence features as they roll out over the next few years.""
