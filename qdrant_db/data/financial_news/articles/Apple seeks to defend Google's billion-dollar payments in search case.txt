Apple <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvoalybovd/apple%20declaration.pdf" target="_blank">does not plan to build its own search engine</a> to compete with Alphabet's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O" target="_blank">(GOOGL.O)</a> Google, whether or not the payments continue, the company's lawyers <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gdpzkajqlvw/Apple%20filing.pdf" target="_blank">said in court papers</a> filed in Washington on Monday. Apple received an estimated $20 billion from its agreement with Google in 2022 alone.
Apple wants to call witnesses to testify at an April trial. Prosecutors will seek to show Google must take several measures, including <a href="/technology/google-prosecutors-propose-cure-search-monopoly-2024-11-20/">selling its Chrome web browser</a> and potentially its Android operating system, to restore competition in online search.
"Google can no longer adequately represent Appleâ€™s interests: Google must now defend against a broad effort to break up its business units," Apple said.
The Department of Justice's prosecution of Google is a landmark case that could reshape how users find online information.
Google has proposed to <a href="/legal/google-says-it-could-loosen-search-deals-us-antitrust-case-2024-12-21/">loosen its default agreements</a> with browser developers, mobile-device manufacturers and wireless carriers, but not to end its agreements to share a portion of ad revenue Google generates from search.
A spokesperson for Google declined to comment on Tuesday.
