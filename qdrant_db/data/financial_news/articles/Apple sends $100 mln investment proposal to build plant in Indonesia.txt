content: Tech giant Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> has sent a $100 million investment proposal to Indonesia to build a plant for accessories and components, the industry ministry said on Wednesday.
The proposal for a plant in West Java came after Indonesia banned sales of Apple's iPhone 16 for its failure to meet local rules. Indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to comprise at least 40% locally-made parts.
