content: Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> on Wednesday hit out at Meta Platforms <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O" target="_blank">(META.O)</a>, saying its numerous requests to access the iPhone maker's software tools to its devices could impact users' privacy and security, underscoring the intense rivalry between the two tech giants.
Under the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act that took effect last year, Apple must allow rivals and app developers to inter-operate with its own services or risk a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover.
Meta has made 15 interoperability requests thus far, more than any other company, for potentially far-reaching access to Apple's technology stack that could affect users' privacy and security, the latter said in a report.
