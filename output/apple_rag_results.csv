Operator, may we\nhave the first question please?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nCertainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan\nStanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring\nHey, guys, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, and\ncongrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you\nunpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us. Obviously, really nice\noutperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross\nmargin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of\noutperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about\nServices growth for the March quarter? And then, speak to some of those underlying\ndrivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different\nputs and takes would be? And then, I have a follow-up please. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri\nThanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up\n11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas,\nin Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically, and\nvery strong across all the Services categories, because we had all-time revenue\nrecords for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising and December quarter\nrecords for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra\nweek, so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than the\n11% that we have reported.\nI think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and\nnew all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is\nobviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double\ndigits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all\nthe services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid\nsubscriptions that we had only four years ago. So, obviously, very significant growth\nthere.\nWhat I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that\nwe will continue to grow double digits at a percentage that is similar to what we\nreported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different\nservices categories. So, we will provide more color when we report in three months.\nErik Woodring\nOkay. Thank you, Luca. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a\nrecord high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a\nbit more detail about the new users you were able to on-board over the last 12\nmonths. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either\nin terms of geographic representation or SKU to certain products or even how their\nmonetization trends might differ from past cohorts. And that's it from me. Thanks so\nmuch.\nTim Cook\nYes. Hi, Erik.

This growth was broad-based geographically, with all-time revenue records in The Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. The outperformance was driven by strong results across all services categories, including cloud, payments, video, advertising, and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q1_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

Additionally, the growth in services was supported by an increase in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, reaching new all-time highs. Paid subscriptions also showed strong double-digit growth, with more than a billion paid subscriptions across Apple's services platform, more than double the number from four years ago (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q1_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

In the subsequent quarter, services revenue continued to show momentum, reaching an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. This growth was attributed to the expanding installed base of active devices and increased customer engagement with Apple's services offerings (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q3_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

Overall, the better-than-expected performance in the services segment was driven by broad-based geographic growth, strong performance across various service categories, and a significant increase in paid subscriptions and customer engagement.","In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned, we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. And also we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets.

The key drivers of this acceleration were strong performances across various service categories, including cloud, video, and payment services, which set all-time revenue records. Additionally, Apple's services saw all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, indicating broad-based growth. The increase in transacting and paid accounts, which grew double digits, also contributed to this acceleration. Furthermore, Apple's installed base of active devices continued to grow, providing a strong foundation for expanding its ecosystem and increasing customer engagement with its services offerings (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q2_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

However, this pace of growth is not expected to be sustainable in the next quarter. Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO, mentioned that the growth rates from the previous year improved over the fiscal year, making the comparisons (comps) for the services business more challenging as they move forward. This suggests that while the current growth is strong, maintaining the same rate of acceleration may be difficult due to tougher year-over-year comparisons (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q2_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

Overall, while Apple is optimistic about its services growth, the expectation is for the growth rate to average out over the first half of the year, rather than continue accelerating at the same pace into the next quarter.","The acceleration was driven by all‑time records across both developed and emerging markets, with especially strong contributions from smaller but fast‑growing categories like cloud, video, and payment services.

Tim Cook mentioned that developers are just beginning to explore the capabilities of Apple Intelligence, and there is excitement about its potential applications across various categories in the App Store, including games and creative apps (Apple Inc. Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript).

Tim Cook also highlighted that Apple Intelligence is being integrated into everyday apps like Notes, Mail, and Messages, which is expected to enhance user experience and engagement (Apple Inc. Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript). The rollout of Apple Intelligence is staggered, with some features already available to developers and more to be released over time, including additional language support and integration with ChatGPT by the end of the calendar year (Apple Inc. Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript).

Regarding the impact on iPhone performance, Tim Cook did not explicitly attribute strong iPhone performance to Apple Intelligence. However, he did mention that Apple Intelligence is a consistent feature across the iPhone 16 series and previous models like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, which could influence consumer behavior and adoption within the iPhone series (Apple Inc. Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript).

Overall, while there is enthusiasm about Apple Intelligence and its potential to enhance the ecosystem, there is no direct statement from Tim Cook attributing strong iPhone performance specifically to Apple Intelligence. The information provided does not fully address the query about the direct impact on iPhone performance, indicating a limitation in the available data.","Within the first three days of the iOS 18.1 launch, adoption in US English was twice as fast as iOS 17.1 last year, with positive feedback from both developers and customers on features like systemwide Writing Tools, a more conversational Siri, intelligent Photos (including text‑driven movie creation), notification summaries, and email summaries/priority. While Cook highlighted this strong interest and upcoming December and 2025 feature rollouts (e.g., expanded Writing Tools, visual intelligence, ChatGPT integration, new languages), he did not explicitly tie Apple Intelligence to the quarter’s strong iPhone performance.",0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0

And so I don't want to present myself as a\neconomist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from\nQ1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for\nthis $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow.

Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of\ncompanies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers\ngoing forward?

I figure it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a\nbit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland\nChina is really notable. Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still\ndeclining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just\ntalk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual\ndecline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you think it's more macro\ndriven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.\nTim Cook\n29/03/2025, 22:37\nApple Inc.

And so I don't want to present myself as a\neconomist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from\nQ1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for\nthis $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means the other\nproducts didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do.\nI think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the\nworld. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that\nbefore, and I believe that it was last quarter as well.

Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO, acknowledged that while China remains the largest emerging market for Apple, other markets such as India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia are showing significant growth. These markets have large and growing populations, and Apple's market share in these regions is relatively low, which presents substantial growth opportunities (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q2_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

The excitement for the Apple brand in these emerging markets is high, and the revenue numbers from these regions are increasing, which is gradually closing the gap with the Greater China segment. However, there is no specific timeline or projection provided in the earnings call that indicates when or if these emerging markets will collectively surpass the revenue from Greater China.

Investors might view these emerging markets as potential growth drivers for Apple, given the positive trends and the company's strategic focus on expanding its presence in these regions. The growth in these markets is supported by strong double-digit revenue growth in India and record revenues in other regions like Indonesia, Latin America, and the Middle East (Apple_Inc_AAPL_Q1_2024_Earnings_Call_Transcript_Seeking_Alpha.txt).

In summary, while there is optimism about the growth potential in emerging markets, the earnings call does not provide a definitive answer on whether or when these markets will surpass the Greater China segment in terms of revenue. Investors should consider these markets as important growth areas but remain aware of the current limitations in the available data.","China remains Apple’s largest emerging market, but other regions—India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia—are seeing rapid growth thanks to large, low‑share populations and strong brand excitement. Collectively, their revenues are rising and closing the gap on China’s segment, and Apple expects that trajectory to continue.",0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.35294117647058826,0.0
