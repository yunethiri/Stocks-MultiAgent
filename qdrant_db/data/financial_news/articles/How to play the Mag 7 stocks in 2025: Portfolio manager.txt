content: The "Magnificent Seven" — made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) — drove major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) higher in 2024. Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager Dan Niles joins Market Domination Co-Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how to play the megacap tech group in the new year.

"I think next year you're going to continue to see the broadening pattern," Niles says, adding that the policies associated with the incoming Trump administration, like lower taxes and deregulation, should support gains widening beyond the Magnificent Seven names.

Watch the video above for Niles' outlook for Nvidia, Microsoft, and the other Magnificent Seven stocks.
