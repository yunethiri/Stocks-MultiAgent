title: Apple begins delicate dance with Tencent in China

summary: Apple will have to tread carefully again in China. The iPhone-maker wants a share of revenue from games played on Tencent's all-in-one WeChat platform. For Apple boss Tim Cook, it's a lucrative opportunity as handset sales cool. Yet if the U.S. company pushes too hard, it may jeopardise its hard-earned appeal in the world's second-largest economy.

content: Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> will have to tread carefully again in China. The iPhone-maker wants a share of revenue from games played on Tencent's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/0700.HK" target="_blank">(0700.HK)</a> all-in-one WeChat platform. For Apple boss Tim Cook, it's a lucrative opportunity as handset sales cool. Yet if the U.S. company pushes too hard, it may jeopardise its hard-earned appeal in the world's second-largest economy.
Tencent Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell on Thursday confirmed that the two companies were in discussions about revenue sharing on so-called mini-games, or titles played directly on WeChat. Many titles can be played without users having to download them from an app store. These apps-within-an-app have taken off since Tencent introduced them six years ago: over half a billion WeChat users play mini-games at least once a month, the company <a href="https://companies.caixin.com/2024-07-17/102216928.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> at a developer conference in July, and advertising revenue from mini-games now account for 15% of WeChat's total.
The bigger windfall for the duo could be in-app transactions, or sales of digital goods and services purchased within mini-games. For normal apps, Apple would typically take a 30% cut. Mitchell confirmed that Tencent currently doesn't monetise its mini-games on Apple's operating system via in-app transactions, but also added that it would be in everyone's interest if there was a way to do so "on terms that we think are economically sustainable and that are also fair".
A lot could be at stake. The recently released Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile game, for instance, as an app grossed over $500 million in sales its first month across Apple and Android platforms, according to research firm Niko Partners. If a mini-game achieved even half of that monthly spending, a 30% commission fee would equal just shy of $1 billion of annual sales.
For Apple, the extra revenue would be welcome. Greater China sales have fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters and the iPhone is ceding market share to local rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/1810.HK" target="_blank">(1810.HK)</a>. Tencent would benefit too and can drive a hard bargain, not least because the Cupertino giant is also under scrutiny in Europe and elsewhere on its app store practices. Apple is on a delicate non-virtual battleground.

CONTEXT NEWS
China's Tencent on Aug. 14 said it was in talks with Apple about sharing revenue from mini-games played on its all-in-one WeChat messaging app.
Speaking on a call with analysts following second-quarter earnings results, the Chinese company's chief strategy officer, James Mitchell, said it would be in Tencent's and Apple's interest if there was a way to offer in-app transactions on mini-games, but "on terms that we think are economically sustainable and that are also fair".
Separately, Apple has demanded Tencent and ByteDance close loopholes that allow app developers to circumvent Apple's typical 30% commission on in-app transactions, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 2, citing people familiar with the matter.
