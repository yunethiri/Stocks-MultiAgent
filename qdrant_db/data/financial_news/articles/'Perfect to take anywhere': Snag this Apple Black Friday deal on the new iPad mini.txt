I still remember when Apple released the first iPad mini. Before getting my hands on one, I thought to myself, "Why not just use your phone?"

The first time I tried it, I understood. It was easier to type on and fit in only one hand, two things I couldn't say about its full-size sibling, but with so much more screen space than a phone.

Now the brand-new iPad mini is already on sale, so you can hold all of that power in the palm of your hand for less.

Why is this a good deal? üí∞

A $49 discount might seem pretty small, but any discount on a brand-new Apple item is noteworthy, especially when it comes to iPads, which tend to hold their value. Priced at $450, this iPad mini with 128GB of memory has never been cheaper.

Why do I need this? ü§î

Think this is just a slightly larger version of your phone? Think again. With a 3:2 aspect ratio compared to the iPhone's 2:1, the iPad mini is much wider and, for those who use their tablets to read, can fit more text and feels more like a book or magazine in your hand. Speaking of fitting in your hand, it's much less cumbersome than the full-size iPad, making it great for travel or slipping into a backpack for your commute.

As far as features go, the iPad mini is packed. It's powered by the A17 Bionic chip, so you should experience zero lag (which I definitely cannot say for my Kindle). It also has a 12-megapixel camera on both the front and back, plus, with its smaller size, you won't look ridiculous holding it up to snap a photo. The optional (but highly recommended) Apple Pencil Pro can turn this tablet into an art studio, whether your medium is photography or digital art.

This is also the first time an iPad mini will have Apple Intelligence. What is Apple Intelligence, you ask? It's Apple's way of making your device even more helpful and personalized. It learns from your habits and preferences to suggest things like reminders for meetings, suggest photos from specific events or even offer predictive text while you type, making things run smoother and faster.

Coupled with the optional Apple Pencil, the iPad mini becomes a powerhouse of an art studio. (Amazon)

What reviewers say üí¨

Since this iPad is so new, it has only a handful of ratings on Amazon so far, most of them five-star. Unsurprisingly, the previous-generation iPad mini has received quite a few five-star ratings ‚Äî close to 10,000, in fact, from shoppers who say it's "a compact powerhouse."

Pros üëç

Portability seems to be one of the biggest draws, including for this five-star reviewer. "I use my iPad for reading, streaming movies/TV shows, as a planner, as a coloring book and sketchbook, and surfing the internet. I also purchased an Apple Pencil, second generation, and I purchased a Paperlike screen protector ‚Äî it helps me write easier and smoother on it. I love this thing! It's perfect to take literally anywhere and fits in most of my purses."

"I am coming from the iPad mini 5th generation and wow is this a huge step up," said another happy customer. "It is super fast. Great feel, quality and awesome camera. The picture quality is unreal. It is very portable even with a case on it. The storage is great. I have 30GB free even after the new iOS install."

"I had been looking for something to take quick notes at work, edit PDFs for simple stuff at work and home, and I had really been getting sick of reading on my phone," shared a final five-star buyer. "We have an iPad Pro 10-inch and the new 10th generation Air, and none of them seem to perform any better than mine does, but the big thing about it that is huge for me is that it is so small and light, super easy to tote around, doesn't really add any weight to my bag."

Cons üëé

"I will say, battery life is subpar, especially when compared with my older iPad Pro," cautioned one purchaser. "The 2021 iPad Mini and 2022 iPad Air that I own don't have the best battery life, but at least they charge up quickly with the included USB-C charger. I guess the newer models don't hold a charge as long, but when I travel, I bring an Anker portable battery with me, just in case."

Some users also miss the home button, which Apple no longer includes on the iPad mini. "You sort of have to fling things off the screen," said this user. "If you like that, it probably works for you. I do not. Takes a while getting used to, and I don't think I ever totally will."

If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)
