Garmin is consistently a trusted leader in the fitness tracker industry, which makes this deal on the Garmin Forerunner 265 pretty great for any serious or aspiring athlete. Through Sept. 22, REI is offering the Garmin Forerunner 265 for just $349.99, down from the list price of $450, which works out to a 22% discount.

From the moment you wake up, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is ready. You'll get a morning report that includes metrics about how well you slept, your recovery trajectory, a daily training outlook, and the weather report. The Garmin calculates a "training readiness" score based on your sleep quality, recovery time, training history, and more, which is kinda like having a mini running coach on your wrist.

The Garmin also comes with impressive battery life, getting up to 13 days of life in smartwatch mode and up to 20 hours in GPS mode. Plus, the Garmin is friends with Android and Apple smartphones, so you'll be good to go regardless of which operating system you prefer.
