Update 11/18/24: We’re continuing to monitor the best Apple deals on Amazon ahead of Black Friday. Although several deals on iPads and AirPods have already gone out of stock or increased slightly, we just found the 2024 MacBook Air on sale for just $899, a record-low price for this just-released laptop.



We’ve said it before, but it bears repeating: Apple typically doesn’t host its own sales, so one of the best times to shop coveted Apple tech is during major savings events at big-box retailers. For Black Friday, the best deals on everything from AirPods and Apple Watches to iPads and MacBooks are already on Amazon, with price cuts of up to 30 percent off.

Just in time for holiday shopping, we even found record-low Apple deals:

Regarding tablets that are as useful for work as for play, does anyone do it better than Apple? Luckily, several iPads are marked down for Black Friday, including the powerful iPad Air, the tenth-generation iPad, and the ultra-portable iPad Mini, which our editors named a solid tablet for kids. Moreover, a range of iPad accessories, including Magic Keyboards and Apple Pencils, are also currently on sale.

Chances are someone on your holiday shopping list is asking for a fresh pair of AirPods, which are currently discounted up to 24 percent. After Apple’s latest AirPods release (AirPods 4 are currently modestly discounted on Amazon if you’d like to shave a few dollars off of the newest model), we expected to see savings on previous generations, including the AirPods Pro 2—and they delivered.

Not only do both of these models boast noise-canceling tech, but they’re also sweat- and water-resistant, making them solid choices for exercising. For anyone who prefers over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max, complete with memory foam ear cushions, are discounted by 18 percent for Black Friday.

As Black Friday draws closer, we’ll keep updating you on the best Apple deals to shop on Amazon. It’s also worth noting that popular Apple products tend to sell out during big sale events, so if you see a deal on Apple tech you’ve been eyeing, we urge you to take advantage of it before it’s too late.
