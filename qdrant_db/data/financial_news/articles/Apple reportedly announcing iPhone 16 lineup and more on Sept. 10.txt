content: Apple will be unveiling new products on September 10, with the announced phones going on sale on September 20, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

That lineup will reportedly include the iPhone 16, with larger screens on the Pro models and a new button just for taking pictures. The phones should also support Apple Intelligence, the company’s suite of AI features announced earlier this year.

The event could also include announcements of the Apple Watch Series 10, which will be thinner than past models, with a larger screen, as well as new AirPods, with noise cancellation coming to more models.

While invites for the September 10 event have not yet gone out, the timing would be consistent with Apple’s press events in recent years.

Gurman also reported that Apple is planning to update its Macs with the M4 processors, but the new Macs probably won’t be announced until later in the fall.
