title: Irish budget surplus to surge to 8% of national income after Apple windfall

summary: Ireland is set to deliver a budget surplus of 8% of modified gross national income (GNI*) in 2024, far higher than an earlier forecast of 2.8% due to the 14 billion euro back tax bill to be paid by Apple , the finance minister said on Friday.
