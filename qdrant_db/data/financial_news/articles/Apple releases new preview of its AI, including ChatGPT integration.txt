Apple on Wednesday released a beta version of a slew of Apple Intelligence features, including its long-awaited ChatGPT integration. The company announced its answer to the AI boom this summer, but is slowly rolling out its features to users. Investors hope AI features will spur a wave of iPhone upgrades because the tools are only available on newer devices. Apple Intelligence has been available in previews for developers and early adopters, but the official public release will come next week as part of the official iOS 18.1 release, Apple said. This latest batch of features is included in a beta version of iOS 18.2 for software developers that was released on Wednesday. Apple developer betas typically go through a cycle of weeks before they are released to the public. The preview included with iOS 18.2 contains: New abilities to describe how the user wants Apple Intelligence to rewrite a chunk of text

Answers from ChatGPT

In June, Apple announced its integration with ChatGPT. Although Apple Intelligence and Siri mostly rely on Apple's chips inside its devices, the company said at the time that for more sophisticated problems or questions, users can get responses from OpenAI's chatbot instead.
