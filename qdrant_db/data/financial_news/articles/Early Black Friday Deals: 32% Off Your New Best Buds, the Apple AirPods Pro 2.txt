If you’ve been eyeing Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 but have been putting off your purchase, Amazon just made an almost irresistible leading into Black Friday. Right now, they’re down to $169.99—that’s a full 32% off from the usual $249.00. For premium sound, noise cancellation, and all the perks of Apple’s latest audio tech, this is one of the best prices we’ve seen for these buds!

These aren’t just any earbuds. With active noise cancellation, they shut out distractions so you can dive into your music, podcasts, or calls. Transparency Mode also keeps you aware of your surroundings when you need it, creating a seamless balance between immersion and awareness. Plus, Personalized Spatial Audio adapts the sound specifically to your ear shape, delivering an immersive experience that’s hard to match. Powered by the advanced H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 2 bring richer sound, stronger connectivity, and improved battery life. And with USB-C charging, they’re as convenient as they are powerful.

PCMag’s audio expert Tim Gideon praised the AirPods Pro 2 for their “exceptional noise cancellation” and noted how they deliver “excellent sound quality that audiophiles and casual listeners alike can appreciate.” This is Apple at its best, packed into sleek, comfortable earbuds designed to elevate everyday listening. This deal won’t last, so you better grab these on-sale AirPods Pro before the price jumps back up.
