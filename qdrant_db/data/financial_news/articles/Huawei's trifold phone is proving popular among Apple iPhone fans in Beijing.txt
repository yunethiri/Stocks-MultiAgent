BEIJING â€” Many of Apple 's affluent iPhone users in China are just as interested in Huawei's pricier trifold phone, CNBC found during spot checks at stores Friday, the day the iPhone 16 and Mate XT launched in the country. Out of 10 people CNBC talked to on Friday, eight said they are interested in both the new Huawei and Apple phones. CNBC talked to five individuals at each company's store during a workday morning. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has sought to rebuild its smartphone business after U.S. sanctions in 2019. Huawei ranked fourth by China smartphone market share in the second quarter, according to Canalys. U.S.-based Apple dropped out of the top five, giving domestic players the top five spots for the first time, the data showed. The iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199, and the iPhone 16 at $799. Huawei's trifold Mate XT starts at the equivalent of more than $2,800.
