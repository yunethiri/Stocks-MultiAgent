content: (Reuters) â€” Amazon (AMZN) said on Wednesday that Apple TV+ will become available on Prime Video later this month in the U.S. for $9.99 per month, in a boost for the iPhone maker. Apple's streaming service has lagged behind rivals Netflix (NFLX), Disney+ (DIS), and Prime Video itself.

Apple TV+, known for its original series like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show and Severance, has differentiated itself in the streaming landscape with a focus on in-house content. The strategy has helped it garner 72 Emmy Award nominations.

Apple TV+, however, is among the streaming platforms with the highest number of customers cancelling a subscription, while Netflix has the lowest, according to market research firm Antenna.

Amazon will add Apple TV+ as a channel on Prime Video, where other streaming services like HBO Max, Discovery+, Starz, Showtime, and Paramount+ are already available.
