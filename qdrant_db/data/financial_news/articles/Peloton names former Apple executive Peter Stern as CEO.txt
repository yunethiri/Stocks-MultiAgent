Peloton's shares jumped 12.5% before the bell.
The company has been run by interim co-CEOs since May, when Barry McCarthy, a former Spotify <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SPOT.N" target="_blank">(SPOT.N)</a> and Netflix <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NFLX.O" target="_blank">(NFLX.O)</a> executive, <a href="/business/peloton-ceo-step-down-2024-05-02/">stepped down</a> after just over two years as the top boss.
Stern, 52, will be tasked with steering Peloton back to growth and achieving positive cash flow by fiscal 2025, building on McCarthy's aggressive cost-cutting measures to align spending with revenue.
