With the October 8 and 9 Prime Day deals upon us, now is the perfect time to go looking for some great Apple deals that will get you ahead of the Prime Day rush. In fact, we’re actually seeing quite a lot of excellent sales across the board, which is why we’ve gone out and collected some of our favorite Prime Day Apple deals for you below. Also, if you’re looking for more specific deals on Apple products, then check out our roundup on these Prime Day MacBook deals, Prime Day smartwatch deals, and Prime Day headphones deals.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB, Boost Mobile) — $0 $1,200 100% off

Christine Romero-Chan / Digital Trends

The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the latest and greatest from Apple, and now you can get it free with Boost Mobile, if you get their Unlimited Plan. Our Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max review makes it clear that this is perfect if you like bigger phones, complimenting the “telephoto lens, the always-on display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and the advanced photography and video recording capabilities” of the phone.

Apple MagSafe Charger — $32 $39 18% off

Apple

The MagSafe Charger is Apple’s wireless charging port. If you haven’t converted yet, are frustrated by the whole USB-C thing, or just notice that the wires on your MagSafe charger are getting frayed, pick this up now.

BUY NOW

Apple AirPods Pro 2 — $199 $249 20% off

Zeke Jones / Digital Trends

By now, the AirPods Pro 2 are considered to be pretty iconic with their premium design that goes well with iPhones. As was stated in our AirPods Pro 2 review, there’s more to the upgraded USB-C version of the ‘pods than just the charger, including an IP54 rating for better dust and water protection.

BUY NOW

Apple AirTag 4 Pack — $75 $99 24% off

Apple

Pop one on your keychain, your backpack, inside your purse, or anywhere else for a simple and easy way to use Apple’s Find My feature with other products you own. Our Apple AirTag review points out how the little machines leverage the global usage of iPhones to your advantage.

BUY NOW

Apple AirPods 4 — $119 $129 8% off

Caleb Denison / Digital Trends

The Apple AirPods 4 are among Apple’s latest batch of buds, and a very fresh batch at that, so it isn’t too surprising that we’re not seeing a discount over 10% just yet. Note that these do not have the ANC feature, but our Apple AirPods 4 (with ANC) review will apply to these buds in almost every other way.

BUY NOW

Apple iPad 9 (64GB) — $224 $329 32% off

.

If you want an affordable iPad, the iPad 9 can’t be beaten right now. Our iPad 9 review praised the tablet for its ability to handle everyday tasks reliably. Note that we found a similar (but slightly more expensive) deal on the iPad 9 in our review of Best Buy’s Big Deal Days deals, but you’ll get the option to easily trade-in your used tech to lower the price even further there.

BUY NOW

Apple Watch Series 9 (GPS, 45mm) — $329 $429 23% off

Apple

The Apple Watch Series 9 was one of the best deals we found in Apple Watch Big Deal Days deals. It first introduced the double-tap feature, allowing you to tap your fingers to control aspects of your watch. This wasn’t the main point of our Apple Watch Series 9 review, however, where we instead focused on the how great of a first Apple Watch this would make, considering its features.

BUY NOW

Apple iPad Mini 6 (64GB) — $380 $499 24% off

Adam Doud/Digital Trends / Digital Trends

Apple’s iPad Mini 6 is at a quite low price right now. Being smaller it is oriented more on the consumption side than the creative side, though our iPad Mini 6 review states that you’ll likely use it for “reading, content consumption, and just a bit of content creation.” The review also mentions that it has loud speakers, which you might not expect for its fit-me-in-your-pocket body size.

BUY NOW

MacBook Air M2 (8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) — $1,049 $1,199 13% off

Digital Trends

The MacBook Air M2 is a fine laptop, as long as you get the right version (avoid the 256GB version). Our MacBook Air M2 review emphasizes the balance work that Apple has done with this laptop, juggling size, performance, and battery life fantastically.

BUY NOW

14.2 inch MacBook Pro M3 (8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) — $1,299 $1,599 19% off

Apple

While its not the M3 Max version that we consider among the best MacBooks to buy, this laptop is pretty darn close. With a 22 hour battery life, Liquid Retina XDR display, and software built for Apple Intelligence, its hard to beat this high-end MacBook while it is at one of its lowest Amazon prices.

How to Choose an Apple Deal on Prime Day

Apple’s current lineup of products is a bit more complex this year compared to a few years ago when your choices were pretty straightforward. For example, there is a new iPhone 16 out, but that lineup seems to be pretty thoroughly targeted to gaming and AI markets. If you don’t have an interest in either, then going for the previous iPhone 15 probably makes a lot more sense, especially if you look at our breakdown of the iPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus.

Luckily, things are a little bit clearer on the laptop side, especially as Apple makes some of the best laptops; if you want a general-use laptop, go for the MacBook Air, and if you want something for creative work, go for the MacBook Pro. Of course, you do then need to worry about the chip you get, but both the M2 and M3 are pretty solid. Also worth noting is that the RAM isn’t great on MacBooks in general, so you’ll have to pay a premium if you want more than 8GB.

When it comes to watches, there is the new Watch Series 10 that you could check out, but the Watch Series 9 is still pretty solid. If you want the best of the best, then the Watch Ultra 2 is the way to go, but that one is incredibly pricey, so you’ll definitely want to wait for a deal on it. On the other hand, if you want a cheaper watch, then the Watch Series SE is the better option, and there are two generations you can pick from, with the latest being the Watch Series SE 2.

How We Chose These Apple Prime Day Deals

Apple is probably the most well-known premium brand in electronics, so naturally, pretty much everything Apple sells is very expensive for the average person. As such, we have quite a bit of experience when it comes to finding and recommending Apple deals, especially given that everything from its laptops to its AirPods are high-end products. Even so, we do our best to find the most significant deals we can before putting them on this page so that we can make sure you get them at the cheapest price they are going for on the market.

Luckily, Prime Big Deal Days is one of the biggest tech sales events of the year, so Apple products tend to have their prices slashed quite significantly. Not only that, but there are a lot of great carrier deals that can bring prices down too, so we’re always on the hunt for finding you the cheapest way to buy Apple products.
