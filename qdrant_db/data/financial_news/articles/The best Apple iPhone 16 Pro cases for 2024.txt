Apple has officially released the iPhone 16 and its variations, including the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Apple's It's Glowtime event revealed the upgrades to the phone, including better screen protection, camera features, and AI integration. Under the hood, the iPhone 16 Pro also boasts an even stronger CPU, with increased memory bandwidth and improved performance. If you've decided that the iPhone 16 Pro is your next buy, you should also get a case to keep it safe.

There are many kinds of cases out there to suit every style or preference. Here are some of our favorites.

Spidercase

Spidercase Translucent iPhone 16 Pro Case

The best budget iPhone 16 case

Pros

Good quality for the price

Comes in multiple colors

Includes screen protector

Cons

No camera protector

The best thing about the Spidercase iPhone 16 Pro Case isn't just its quality — it's the price you pay for that level of quality. It regularly costs under $20 for this translucent matte model, even at full price.

The Spidercase iPhone 16 Pro case excels in its simplicity. While it might not be the flashiest case, it covers all the basics and has some colorful options to boot. Its raised edges protect the delicate parts of the phone and reinforced corners absorb the shock from odd-angled drops up to 12 feet. The two glass screen protectors included with the case also save you the trouble of buying them separately.

Pelican Voyager iPhone 16 Pro Case

The best protective iPhone 16 Pro case

Pros

Four-layer protection

Additional accessories

Includes belt clip

Cons

Bulky

The Pelican Voyager iPhone 16 Pro Case might just be the thickest on this list. It features four protective layers made of hard polycarbonate and soft elastomer, similar to the Otterbox Defender, but without the brand name. The anti-scratch coating and raised edges also protect your screen and camera. It has double the layers of many competitors and exceeds military grade drop protection standards.

As a bonus, the Pelican Voyager iPhone 16 Pro Case also comes with a belt clip so you can keep it at your side.

Temdan

Temdan iPhone 16 Pro Waterproof Case

The best waterproof iPhone 16 Pro case

Pros

Takes photos underwater

Built-in screen and camera protector

Strong protection

Cons

Not many customization options

Want to take a dip? The Temdan iPhone 16 Pro Waterproof Case lets you take your phone anywhere, even underwater. Its IP68 rating certifies that it could stay submerged up to 1.5 meters underwater for 30 minutes without any issues. That way, you can use it during outdoor activities like swimming, snorkeling, and surfing. Its tempered glass screen protector also maintains the response sensitivity of the bare screen. Just be sure to close any holes with the silicone plugs before you go under. Temdan recommends testing the case underwater before putting your phone inside, just to make sure you know how it works before risking your device.

In addition to its water-resistant features, this Temdan iPhone 16 Pro Case features a shockproof outer nlayer that meets military grade drop test standards and a MagSafe-compatible back.

i-Blason

i-Blason Armorbox

The best drop protection

Pros

Rugged, military-grade protection

20-foot drop protection

Built-in screen protector and kickstand

Camera control button compatible

Cons

No water resistance

Military-grade drop-tested cases that can protect your expensive new iPhone 16 Pro are not easy to come by. i-Blason’s MagSafe-compatible Armorbox has you covered. It comes with a built-in screen protector, so you don’t need anything extra, plus it has a built-in camera cover that doubles as a kickstand. The zinc alloy anodized camera cover protects the high-power lenses on the back of the phone. The most unique feature on the Armorbox is the built-in camera control button which utilizes copper conductors to seamlessly match the operations of the unique button. It’s rugged through and through so it’ll survive a 20-foot drop

Even with that protection it’s not bulky, it’s not ugly, and it works with so many different MagSafe accessories because of its powerful N52 magnet. For example, you can still mount your phone to a hands-free car adapter, even while it’s still in the case.

From now until October 9, on Amazon you can enjoy 10% off on iPhone 16 series cases.

Speck Candyshell Grip iPhone 16 Pro Case

The best grip-friendly iPhone 16 Pro case

Pros

Simple, but good at its job

Cushioned double layer

MagSafe compatibility

Cons

Expensive

Speck has been in the consumer tech accessory market since 2001, so of course, it's be ready for the launch of the iPhone 16 Pro with this specially fitted case.

This case features the company's signature CandyShell Grip coating, a slim layer made of silicone-like material with textured lines to help it grip to your pocket and palms. The case also keeps your phone relatively well-protected thanks to its double-layer construction and raised bezel to protect the screen and camera. All the basics are there, including MagSafe-compatible charging and an accessible design that easily responds to button presses.

Apple

Apple Silicone Case with MagSafe and Camera Control

Best official case for iPhone 16 Pro

Pros

Variety of colors

Soft touch material

Protection from everyday wear and tear

Seamless Camera Control cover

MagSafe compatible

Cons

Pricey

Can get lint and debris stuck easily

The Apple Silicone Case is a good option if you prefer official cases from Apple. The soft touch silicone material feels excellent and should add some grip to the device. It provides durable protection from everyday wear and tear, and the microfiber lining keeps it safe from scratches. It also has a relatively slim profile, making it a good choice if you don't like bulky cases.

Apple also made this case MagSafe compatible, and there is a seamless cover for the Camera Control that is made with sapphire crystal and has a conductive layer for flawless touch control.

The only thing to keep in mind is that the silicone can easily attract lint and debris, and it's also a bit pricey since it's an official Apple case.

Sonix

Sonix Jelly Case with MagSafe

Best subtle color case for iPhone 16 Pro

Pros

Jelly colors add a subtle tint to your iPhone

10-foot protection

MagSafe compatible

Plenty of colors

Cutout for Camera Control access

Cons

More on the feminine side

Sonix is a good brand if you want cases that are cute and stylish. The Jelly colors make for a translucent semi-transparent case that, when combined with your iPhone color, give a unique tint to the device. So if you have a darker color device, it will look darker, while lighter colors will make the selected color lighter. This is also a good option if you wanted a pink iPhone 16 Pro, but are disappointed that Apple could not deliver that yet again.

The Sonix cases have also been tested for up to 10-feet of drop protection and are compatible with MagSafe. The case also features tactile button covers, and there is a cutout for easy access to the Camera Control button. And if the jelly colors aren't your thing, there are other patterns and designs to choose from too.

If you want a simple clear case to show off your new Desert Titanium iPhone 16 Pro, then this case from ESR gets the job done.

The MagSafe is also very strong, so any MagSafe accessories should have no trouble staying attached with this case. And best of all, it's super affordable. You just can't beat that.

Pros

This case also comes in plenty of fun colors, like this sparkly pink glitter. But there are other colors and patterns if that's not your thing.

The Symmetry Series case has a MagSafe ring to make it work with all of your MagSafe accessories. There is also a large cutout opening for the Camera Control button.

Pros

Plenty of cute and stylish designs

8-foot drop protection

Tactile buttons

MagSafe compatibility

Cutout for Camera Control

Cons

Not for those who don't like a feminine style

Velvet Caviar has made a name for itself since 2014. It has some of the most fashionable and unique case designs out there, and it doesn't skimp on protection either. These cases are drop-tested up to 8 feet, so your iPhone 16 Pro will be safe and sound. There are also plenty of cute designs and patterns to choose from, as well as some more basic colors too. Velvet Caviar always has fun seasonal drops too, so you can dress your phone up for the holidays.

The aluminum buttons have an excellent tactile feel to them, and there are also dual lanyard attachment points if you want to use a lanyard. The Modern Leather Case has MagSafe and a cutout for easy access to the Camera Control.
