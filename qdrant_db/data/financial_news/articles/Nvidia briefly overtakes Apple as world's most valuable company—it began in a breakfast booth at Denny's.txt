content: Chipmaker Nvidia temporarily dethroned Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Monday — another stop on the company's unlikely journey from startup to tech giant.

Nvidia shares rose Monday morning, boosting its market value to $3.38 trillion by the afternoon, surpassing Apple's $3.35 trillion market cap. The news came just days after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 30-member index that's often viewed as a key metric of the U.S. economy.

By Monday evening, Apple bounced back to the top with a $3.38 trillion market value, compared to Nvidia's $3.34 trillion.

Nvidia's dominant market position, driven largely by its development of powerful computer chips that can power artificial intelligence models, is lightyears from its roots as a 3D graphics company for video games. Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang and his two friends, engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, started the business in 1993 while eating at a Denny's restaurant in San Jose, California, Huang told CBS' "60 Minutes." in April.

Huang was 30 years old, married and a father of two when inspiration struck him at the same restaurant where he once worked as a busboy at age 15, he said.

"We came right here to this Denny's, sat right back there, and the three of us decided to start the company," said Huang.. "Frankly, I had no idea how to do it, nor did they. None of us knew how to do anything."
