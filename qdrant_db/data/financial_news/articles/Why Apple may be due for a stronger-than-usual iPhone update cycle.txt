content: Apple (AAPL) launches its iOS 18.2 update today. Some features in the update include ChatGPT integration into Siri and creating your own emojis.

Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin sits down with Asking for a Trend Anchor Josh Lipton to talk about how the new iOS update could impact iPhone demands and sales.

"I think the super cycle term gets thrown around," says Bajarin. "I mean, I'm just still of the strong conviction that hardware changes, design changes drive those super cycles, not software. I do still think this is going to be a stronger-than-normal upgrade cycle only because we've known that this is an aging base."

Bajarin went out to talk about the partnership between Apple and Sam Altman's OpenAI, the company that develops ChatGPT.

"I think OpenAI, they're not Google. In no way, shape, or form are they brand-recognized or used as much as Google," says Bajarin. "So you could see the differences of this deal between a Google for search and ChatGPT and OpenAI for other features."
