content: Had you invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 in 1965, it would be worth around $325,053 today. However, had you invested $1,000 in shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) at the very same time, it would now be worth a whopping $42.5 million.

It was 1965 when Warren Buffett became the CEO of Berkshire. Now, he oversees a $291 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, in addition to several private wholly owned businesses. Berkshire is also sitting on $325 billion in cash, which Buffett and his team can put to work when they spot new opportunities.

Given Berkshire's incredible performance relative to the S&P 500, it's no surprise that Wall Street watches Buffett's every move. According to the conglomerate's 13-F filings, he is on a major selling spree in 2024.

However, Berkshire's financials for the third quarter revealed something even more surprising. For the first time in six years, Buffett didn't buy his favorite stock. Here's why that should be setting off alarm bells on Wall Street.

Buffett slashed Berkshire's largest position this year

Berkshire spent around $38 billion buying shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) between 2016 and 2023, which is the most money it has ever invested in a single company. That position was worth over $170 billion at the start of 2024, so Berkshire was sitting on a very nice gain.

Apple accounted for half of the value of Berkshire's entire portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities at that point. The conglomerate did sell small quantities of Apple stock over the years to cash in some of its gains, but it significantly ramped up the selling in 2024.

Berkshire offloaded 13% of its Apple position in the first quarter, which Buffett said was for tax reasons. But the conglomerate then sold 49% of its remaining Apple shares in the second quarter, followed by 25% of what was left in Q3. No real reasons were provided.

Apple remains Berkshire's largest position with a 25.7% weighting in its portfolio, so Buffett probably hasn't adopted a highly negative view on the company. Besides, it wasn't the only stock Berkshire trimmed this year.

In 2024 so far, Berkshire reduced its stake in Chevron, T-Mobile, Capital One Financial, and Bank of America. It also sold its entire positions in Paramount Global, HP, Floor & Decor Holdings, and artificial intelligence company Snowflake.

As I mentioned earlier, Berkshire is now sitting on $325 billion in cash. It's the biggest pile of dry powder the conglomerate has ever held.
