Apple first announced the Apple Watch Series 10 over two months ago. At the time, it revealed three sharp-looking link bracelets to complement the higher-end titanium models, which are available in natural, slate and gold.

While these link bracelets have been available in natural and slate finishes since launch, the gold version has been MIA. That’s just changed.

A Gold Link Bracelet

The gold version of Apple’s Link Bracelet is exactly like the natural and slate versions. It’s comprised of over 100 components, each of which is made of 316L stainless steel alloy.

According to Apple, the machining process to create these link bracelets is so precise that “it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band.”

Several of the links have a simple release button, making it easy to add or remove links — no special tools required — and help you get the perfect fit.

Each link bracelet features a custom butterfly closure.

Price and availability

Apple’s Gold Link Bracelet is available for order right now on the company’s website, but there’s a catch. If ordered today, expect it to arrive between December 20th and 30th — so there’s a change it won’t arrive before Christmas.

The Gold Link Bracelet is available in two sizes, each to fit the two sizes of the Series 10: 42mm and 46mm. Both sizes cost $349.

The smaller 42mm and larger 46mm sizes will work with older Apple Watch models that came in 41mm and 45mm sizes, respectively. The larger model will work with the Ultra and Ultra 2, which only comes in one 49mm size.
