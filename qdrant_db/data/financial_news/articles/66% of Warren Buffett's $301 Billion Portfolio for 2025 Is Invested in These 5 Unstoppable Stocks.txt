content: For the better part of six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a masterclass in investing for Wall Street. Since ascending to the role as CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,561,176%, as of the closing bell on Dec. 12, and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.

Vastly outperforming Wall Street's most-followed stock index has earned the Oracle of Omaha quite the following. It's why investors eagerly await Berkshire's Form 13F filings each quarter so they can see which stocks Buffett has been buying and selling.

While Berkshire's chief has historically invested in businesses with sustainable moats and strong management teams, perhaps the most-defining characteristic of Buffett's investing philosophy is his penchant for concentration. He believes his best ideas are worthy of an outsized investment.

As we ready to turn the page to a new year, Warren Buffett appears poised to enter 2025 with 66% ($199.1 billion) of the $301 billion portfolio he oversees at Berkshire Hathaway invested in the following five unstoppable stocks.

Apple: $74.4 billion (24.7% of invested assets)

Though tech goliath Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the largest holding at Berkshire by a considerable amount, it's worth noting that Buffett has overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock, in aggregate, over the previous four quarters, ended Sept. 30.

During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett opined that tax purposes were behind the recent selling activity. He intimated that the corporate income tax rate was likely to climb, which would make locking in sizable unrealized gains at a favorably low corporate income tax rate a smart move.

In hindsight, this hasn't worked at as planned. With Donald Trump winning in November, the corporate income tax is likely to remain at its lowest level since 1939, or perhaps head even lower.

Despite paring down two-thirds of Berkshire's stake in Apple, Warren Buffett continues to appreciate consumers' love for the Apple brand, as well as Tim Cook's top-notch leadership. Cook is overseeing an ongoing transformation that has his company focused on higher-margin subscription services.

Additionally, Buffett is a huge fan of hearty capital-return programs. On top of Apple dishing out $1 per share in dividends each year -- Berkshire is on track to collect $300 million in dividend income from its Apple stake in 2025 -- it has the largest share repurchase program on the planet. It's bought back $700.6 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013.
