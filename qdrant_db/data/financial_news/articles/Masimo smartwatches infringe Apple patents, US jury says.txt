The jury, in Delaware, agreed with Apple that Masimo's W1 and Freedom watches violated Apple's patent rights in smartwatch designs, awarding the tech giant $250 in damages. Apple's attorneys told the court the "ultimate purpose" of its lawsuit was to win an injunction against sales of Masimo's smartwatches after an infringement ruling.
