content: There isn't a money manager who commands more attention from the investment community than billionaire Warren Buffett. In his nearly six decades as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), the aptly dubbed "Oracle of Omaha" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of greater than 5,660,000%, as of the closing bell on Nov. 14.

Buffett's ability to consistently outperform Wall Street's major indexes over lengthy timelines has some investors eager to ride his coattails. Thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this can be done with relative ease.

A 13F is a required filing by institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides investors with a snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Nov. 14 was the filing deadline to disclose trading activity for the September-ended quarter.

Consistent with Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs over the last two years, Buffett and his team have been net sellers of equities and very selective buyers. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, one top holding continues to get the heave-ho, while another beloved consumer goods brand is suddenly a popular buy.

Shares of Berkshire's top holding continue to be shown to the door

Based on Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated cash flow statements, Buffett and his team have sold more stocks than they've purchased for eight consecutive quarters (dating back to Oct. 1, 2022), totaling an aggregate of $166.2 billion. No stock accounts for a greater percentage of this $166.2 billion than top consumer brand Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30, Berkshire Hathaway has sold 615,560,382 shares of Apple, which reduced its stake in Wall Street's second-largest company by a staggering 67%. Keep in mind that even after dumping 615.56 million shares of Apple, it's still Berkshire's largest holding by almost $25 billion in market value.

During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, Buffett opined during the question-and-answer session with investors that the corporate income tax rate would likely head higher. He thus intimated that selling Apple's stock was a way for Berkshire to lock in sizable unrealized gains at a favorable tax rate.

However, with Donald Trump winning the presidency and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, corporate income tax increases look to be firmly off the table for at least the next four years. Considering that Apple's stock has risen significantly on its artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations as Buffett has sold, it's fair to say that Berkshire Hathaway has missed out on a pretty penny in gains.
