content: When Apple launched iOS 18 in September, it was perhaps the first time that the company's round number release was the most important iOS release of the year.

That's because the company opted for a slow, staggered launch of its AI (Apple Intelligence) features, most of which weren't available in iOS 18. Today, with the launch of iOS 18.2, nearly all of these features are live on the iPhone, the iPad, and on the Mac.
