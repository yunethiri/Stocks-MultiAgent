content: Amazon A magnetic battery pack , affordable puck MagSafe charger and 2-in-1 charging stand

If you own an Apple iPhone 12 or later, then you can take advantage of all of the benefits of MagSafe for wireless charging and power transfer. This means you can charge your iPhone wirelessly, but with the power of MagSafe magnets to securely keep your iPhone in place when charging

Additionally, this means you can easily add accessories to your iPhone, like a battery pack to extend your smartphone’s battery life instead of trying to search for a wall outlet for some quick juice. MagSafe is a great feature to have, but much like everything from Apple, you’re going to have to pay a premium price to get your hands on MagSafe chargers and accessories.

In fact, one MagSafe wireless charging puck with a little over three-foot charging cable goes for $39 at Apple’s website . With some of the MagSafe chargers we found on Amazon and Walmart, you can get three perfectly compatible chargers for the price of just one from Apple. What’s more, the chargers we found from brands like Anker and Belkin offer way more charging potential that any of Apple’s proprietary MagSafe chargers, which only come in the flat puck variation described above

Ahead, you’ll find our recommendations for the best MagSafe chargers that are more competitive (either in terms of price or functionality) than anything that’s made by Apple.

If you’re looking for a two-in-one charger for your nightstand, then the Anker MagGo charging stand is for you. It features a wireless charging pad for your Apple AirPods, as well as a MagSafe charger for your Apple iPhone. It also doubles as a stylish alarm clock when the iPhone is docked (and if StandBy mode is enabled on your device). Just put your smartphone in landscape mode for a handsome digital timepiece.



Promising review: “Finally moved from a hard connection charging stand to MagSafe charging. My reason was the slowness of other MagSafe devices but this stand with 15W of power is only an hour slower than directly thru the Apple supplied wired charger for overnight charging. Strong hold on the phone with its Torras MagSage case. Maybe a little too strong but that’s better than the other way.” — W. Hohauser

Do you travel a lot? If the answer is yes, then the Anker MagSafe charger stand is a compact cube that transforms into a portable charging dock for nightstands in hotel rooms. It even has a slide out “shelf” to charge an Apple Watch, and you can place your Apple AirPods behind the MagSafe charger when in use. The charger is the ideal solution for traveling with a few personal devices, as it offers a way to charge three devices at once. It’s also lightweight at just over 14 ounces.



Promising review: “This little cube saved me so much trouble. I'd been using that triangle-shaped Anker dock for my Apple products on a road trip and the thing took up way to much room in my luggage. Having this cube was just what I needed. I have an Apple Watch, AirPods, and iPhone and appreciate being able to charge everything and have this fold up real small to pack back into my luggage.” — Rob Myers

Promising review: “By purchasing this product, it has made charging my Apple iPhone much easier. No more long cords Jess placed on the charging station and go. I am still able to finish watching a movie or a video while charging. I love this best thing they ever came out with.” — Dawn Gunn

A classic charging puck that

A classic charging puck that

The Anker MagSafe charging pad is a simple wireless charging puck that connects to the Apple iPhone with MagSafe. It may not be fancy with a lot of bells and whistles, this charger pad is just strong and reliable with a 4.2 out of 5-star rating from more than 900 Amazon shoppers.

Belkin

A jazzy 3-in-1 stand

This T-shaped MagSafe charging stand from Belkin is a three-in-one charger that works with the Apple iPhone, Apple AirPods, and Apple Watch, so you never need three separate chargers to juice up your devices. It can also charge your iPhone in landscape or portrait modes, and it’s pretty stylish and sleek, as a nightstand charger.



Promising review: “Bought this used and I’m thrilled with it, it will have a permanent place by my bedside as long as I use Apple products. Much more convenient than wrangling multiple MagSafe cords and chargers, with an attractive design and a sturdy weight. My only disappointment is that the AirPods charger on the base is not MagSafe, but given the nature of gravity it doesn’t have to be. The full price is a touch high but you are getting a quality product of good material and design. A very Apple feel, this product is honestly better than most of Apple’s own charging solutions. If you have an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and AirPods, this product will make your life easier and more elegant.” — Paolo Naccari

Belkin

A tabletop 2-in-1 charging station that’s “built like a tank”

Belkin's 2-in-1 MagSafe charging dock, which comes in black and sand, is an elegant solution to charging an Apple iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time. The adjustable MagSafe top of the charger folds up and down, so you can use it for either an iPhone or AirPods depending on how you position it. Meanwhile the adjustable Apple Watch charger either sits behind the iPhone, or at its side. The soft-touch casing is equipped with a non-slip base that helps anchor the station wherever it’s placed.



Promising review: “I'm going to sing the praises of the Belkin. It's built like a tank. There's no sliding around on my bedside table. MagSafe works exactly like it should. And it's stylish. If you compare the price of this to a standalone Apple-branded MagSafe charger plus a third party stand, the premium isn't insanely large.” — Brian S in DC

Anker

An 8-in-1 charging station that can lighten your travel load or instantly declutter your workspace

This spherical MagSafe charger from Anker is another must-have for travel, thanks to its compact size (under five inches in diameter), strong MagSafe wireless iPhone charger, and a slew of power inputs camouflaged on the rear of the device. It comes with three outlets for a MacBook Air, two USB-C ports for a pair of headphones, and two USB-A ports for an e-reader or older tablet. In fact, it can charge up to eight devices at the same time, and is powered by a single cord. Even if you're not a big traveler, this feels like a smart buy, as it has the potential to remove countless wires from your desk-scape.



Promising review: “I decided to set this thing up on my desk for the sake of decluttering my work space. Where it sits on my desk leaves it convenient for charging my phone and out of the way of other screens on my desk. I will say that it can be a bit front heavy when placing your phone on the wireless pad. However when you hook up a couple things to the back of its ports it evens out. The product is also very nice looking, and has a matte finish on it. Small enough to pack a lot of output power for my monitors and console under my desk!” — Joji

Want a hands-free solution for using Apple CarPlay on your iPhone? This handy MagSafe mount attaches to your car’s temperature control vents, using its magnetic properties to keep your iPhone secure and in place when driving. The car mount is also removable, so you can move it between vehicles if need be.



Promising review: “The charger itself – just fabulous. Well-built, sturdy, super stable magnets and charging speeds with an Apple iPhone are on-par if not slightly better than Apple. It's REALLY NICE that the charging puck is detachable – you can modify this to be a table-top charger or standing charger if you get the right parts. If the mounts break, you can replace it from ESR probably or buy spares from other sellers.” — BlueBird

This sturdy magnetic battery pack from Anker can give your Apple iPhone up to an additional 19 hours of juice. Just slap it on the back of your device and let the MagSafe battery do the rest. It’s ideal for traveling, or attending an event or convention, when you can’t get to a wall outlet.



Promising review: “I like Anker's products because I feel like their products are quality and a better value than the OEM versions. I have an iPhone 13 Mini and when I am out and need an extra battery, I can take off my MagSafe wallet and put this on for a while to get more charge without too much bulk. Since my phone is small, I can still put it in my pocket and use the phone as normal. I'm still not sold on Qi charging - since chorded charging is so much faster, but I can't complain about the convenience.” — ReedRichards

No more looking at the ceiling or the countertop. LOL. I actually saw their faces during the entire conversation.” — Daughter
