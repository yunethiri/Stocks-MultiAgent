Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Air\\n®\\n13-in. and MacBook Air 15-in.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Air\\n®\\n13-in. and MacBook Air 15-in.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.
