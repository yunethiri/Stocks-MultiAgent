content: On a day where President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Wall Street failed to build on a furious rally that has picked up steam after his election win. In focus was fresh inflation data, which helped cast doubt on investor confidence for the path of interest rates ahead.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were both about 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 0.6% while shares of Apple (AAPL) rallied less than 1% to close at a record high.

In bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added 5 basis points to hit 4.32%, its highest closing level since Nov. 22.

The market received another piece of the inflation puzzle on Thursday — an update on wholesale prices — after the latest consumer inflation data invigorated stocks on Wednesday, lifting the Nasdaq above 20,000 for the first time.

The in-line consumer price index reading cleared one of the last remaining risks to easing by the Fed in December. That boosted bets on a quarter-point rate cut in December to a near 99% chance, per the CME FedWatch tool.

But the November producer price index released on Thursday morning came in hotter than expected, rising 0.4% from the previous month. Economists had been expecting an increase of 0.2%. That has put the chances of the Fed holding rates steady in January in focus, as several officials have voiced a cautious stance on policy.

A downbeat revenue forecast from Adobe (ADBE) also helped dampen the mood, revealing the Photoshop maker's struggle for a payoff from its AI investments. Shares in the software maker sank nearly 14%.
