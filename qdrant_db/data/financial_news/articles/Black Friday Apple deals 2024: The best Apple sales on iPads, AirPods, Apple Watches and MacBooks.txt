Apple devices have a few things in common: they’re well-designed, solidly built and easily connect with one another. But chances are, if it bears the Apple logo, it’s not cheap. That’s why promos like Black Friday are always worth checking out if you’re in the market for a new Apple device. We’ve reviewed nearly every major release from the company over the last 20 years, including the newest products for 2024, like the AirPods 4, the M4 iPad Pro, the M4 Mac Mini and more. Some of those devices are seeing their first discounts for Black Friday and others are dipping back to the lows they saw earlier in the year. Here are the best Apple Black Friday deals we could find from retailers across the web.

The only problem is iPads are among the more expensive tablets you can buy. Hopefully these Black Friday iPad deals help out.

Apple has four models of AirPods right now: The AirPods Pro 2, the over-ear AirPods Max and two AirPods 4, one with active noise cancellation and one without. Apple has been doing a lot of interesting things with their headphones lately, making this a good time to dive in. Though the discounts for Black Friday look to be minor, it's better than paying full price.
