This year’s Black Friday deals are far from over, even with the event behind us. For Apple fans who want to take advantage of the shopping event to buy a MacBook, there’s an offer from Best Buy that you shouldn’t miss. The 256GB model of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3 is on sale with a $250 discount that slashes its price from $1,099 to $849, but probably not for long, as Black Friday MacBook deals will be gone soon. You’re going to have to be quick to add it to your cart, though, because this rare 22% discount won’t last long.

Why you should buy the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3

Our team is a big fan of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3. It currently holds the title as the very best MacBook you can buy in our rankings of the best MacBooks, and it all starts with the performance of Apple’s M3 chip. Combined with an eight-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, and 16GB of RAM, the Apple MacBook Air M3 will barely break a sweat when handling your daily activities — even when you’re multitasking between several apps.

Another important thing about the Apple MacBook Air M3 is that it’s simply stunning, with a beautiful design that’s just 0.44 inches thick and a gorgeous 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display that supports 1 billion colors. The efficiency of the processor allows it to go fanless, so it’s completely quiet while you’re using it, and its battery can last up to 18 hours from a full charge. The Apple MacBook Air M3 is also fitted with two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 5, a MagSafe 3 port for charging, and a headphone jack.

For Black Friday, Best Buy is selling the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3 with a 256GB SSD for only $849, a savings of $250 on the laptop’s original price of $1,099. It’s not a surprise that there’s high demand for Black Friday Apple deals, and this offer won’t be an exception. There’s a chance that this discount doesn’t make it through the rest of the weekend, so if you want to buy the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air M3 for less than $1,000, you should add it to your cart and proceed with the checkout process immediately.
