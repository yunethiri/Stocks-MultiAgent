Apple‘s hardware is known for its innovative design, longevity, and relatively high price tag, but the company hasn’t participated in any big sales or offers for several years. If you want a deal on Apple’s gear, you’ll have to look elsewhere.

More from Rolling Stone

Luckily, most major retailers have begun offering end of year sales on Apple’s slate of products. These are new, unopened products — not deals on refurbished or open box stock. If you know where to shop, you’ll never have to pay full price for a MacBook, AirPods, iPad, or Apple Watch again.

What Are the Best Apple Deals?

We’ve rounded up the best Apple deals you can get on their newest gear below. Keep in mind that Apple’s products are always in high demand, and global supply chain issues mean there’ll be even fewer items in stock than usual. If you see a deal you like, now’s the time to take advantage of it.

While Apple.com doesn’t do a specific sale, you can find a number of Apple deals on Amazon right now. Prime members will also be able to get free shipping on their purchases, saving you a few extra dollars online. We’ve also included a few deals from Target and Walmart.

We’ll update this article regularly as sales events come and go, but the deals and prices below were active at the time of publication.

BEST AIRPODS DEAL

Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)

$149.99 $169.00 11% off

Buy Now On Amazon

The AirPods 4 may be out soon but Apple’s AirPods (3rd Gen) are still among the best true wireless earbuds you can get, and the top choice if you pair them with another Apple device like the iPhone. Still our go-to buds, the AirPods are sweat-resistant and water-resistant, super comfortable, and get up to 30 hours of battery life with the included charging case.



Most importantly, the AirPods sound great. Apple’s Personalized Spatial Audio uses dynamic head tracking to immerse you in your music and movies, with sound tuned just for you. Everything comes through crisp and clear.



Normally $169+, the AirPods are just $149.99 on Amazon right now.

BEST BEATS EARBUDS DEAL

Beats Fit Pro True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

$159.00 $199.95 20% off

Buy Now On Amazon

Beats (or Beats by Dre) is now owned by Apple, and the collaboration is on full display with these Beats Fit Pro earbuds, which are on sale for 20% off.



The wireless earbuds use Apple’s H1 headphone chip, which offers improved performance, better pairing (and switching between devices) and the ability to connect you buds to Siri for voice commands. Noise cancellation technology immerses you in the music — and not on distracting outside crickets and chatter. The unique wingtips, meantime, allow for a flexible yet secure fit.



With six hours of battery life (24 hours with the charging case), sweat resistance, seamless pairing with Apple devices, and high-end sound, they’re well worth their price, even before their 20% discount.

The top-of-the-line, over-the-ear cans are more streamlined than previous models, making them great for the gym or for traveling, and they offer even better sound quality than Beats’ already stellar earbuds.

BEST MACBOOK DEAL

Apple 2022 MacBook Air Laptop

$799.00 $999.00 20% off

Buy Now On Amazon

The cheapest MacBook deals online are at Walmart, where you can find restored (or refurbished) Apple laptops from just $169 here. But if you’re looking for a brand new MacBook, the lowest price we’re seeing is $799 on Amazon for a 2022 MacBook Air.



This model has 8GB of RAM (memory) and 256GB of storage, which means it’s perfect for just about every type of use, from work to school to gaming. The M2 chip also puts Apple’s 13.6-inch MacBook Air into a league of its own compared to laptops in this size class. It’s viable to use this machine for professional work like editing video, high-resolution photos, or multi-track audio recordings without worrying about it slowing down. This processor is several times faster than the one it replaces and efficient enough to allow Apple’s laptop to last up to 18 hours on a single charge.



You don’t typically see a lot of Apple laptop sales online so this is a deal you’ll want to take advantage of. See more MacBook deals here.
